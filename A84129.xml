            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface to the Reader.</head>
            <p>THe Lord our good God is infinite in all perfections, and incomprehensible by a finite Creature; the highest Angels may as soon lade all the water out of the deep Ocean with a spoon, as they can with their utmost abilities attain to the full knowledge of the great Lord; but blessed be his holy Name for his cleare reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of himselfe to us in his Word of Truth, to be but one in essence, most singularly one, and three glorious Persons, and that we may know so much of him, if we be not wanting in our search, as is necessary for our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>It hath been the sinfull and industrious practise of the ancient Heretiques, as the laborious <hi>Magdeburgensians</hi> have observed, <hi>Centur.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. either wholly to overthrow, or else to corrupt, at least to darken the Doctrine of the sacred Trinity, and to abolish the true apprehension of the Lord Almighty out of the mindes of men, to weaken the Article touching our blessed Saviour, and to intangle that saving Doctrine touching his Person and merits with many errors; but the vigilancy of the spirituall Guides, and Pastors of the Christian Church, even then, by Gods blessing, when they were not assisted with the sword of
<pb facs="tcp:118911:3"/>secular powers rooted up, or at least kept downe those noysome weeds, that they did not much annoy the Wheat that grew in this happy Field: and notwithstanding the opposition of these, and all other Heretiques, <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> the City of God, was strong and beautifull, well compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted together, and in these main fundamental Articles harmonious and united together.</p>
            <p>It is not denied, as we finde by the light of History, that the Heathen persecuting Emperours kept downe the Church from carrying any pompous visibility in the world, and if the flesh had drawn her Picture (saith <hi>Luther in Psal.</hi> 10. <hi>Graduum</hi>) she would have been painted like a deformed and poor Virgin, sitting in a perillous Wood in the midst of hungry Lions and Wolves, and surroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with furious Thieves seeking to kill her, and amongst venemous Serpents. To omit all the rest, in that last and bloudy persecution, which continued ten years, begun by <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> was made a great Army of Christian Martyrs, a hundred thousand, &amp; forty thousands in Egypt alone (to say nothing of the banished ones for the name of Christ) saith <hi>Scaliger de Emendat. Tempor. lib.</hi> 5.1. <hi>an. Dioclesian.</hi> If that litle Province had so much innocent bloud shed in it, who can without tears recount the infinite Ocean, which was spilt in all the Roman Empire?</p>
            <p>These good Christians had prayed long and fervently that the Woman, the Church, might bring forth a man Child, which should rule all Nations, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12. and our wise God and mercifull Father (lest the Spirits of his Children should faile) gives them in due time a Christian Emperor, <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, to be a nursing Father to his poore Church, and happily to stanch the issues of blood, which the bloud-sucking Tyrants had wickedly shed. <hi>Jerusalem</hi> then, as was foretold, <hi>Esa.</hi> 19.23. increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb facs="tcp:118911:3"/>on the right hand and on the left, untill the Host of our <hi>David</hi> became great, as the Host of God, and his seed as the Army of Heaven which cannot be numbred; then there began to be a path from <hi>Egypt</hi> to <hi>Assyria,</hi> and one Nation communicated with another in the Worship of the living God.</p>
            <p>The Divel, the enemy of God and his Christ, raged to see his first-born sons, the Heathen Emperours, which were open professed Enemies to Christianity, cast out of the imperial Throne, and Christians to sit in their seats: the Divel, I say, this <hi>Mille-Artifex</hi> laboured to do mischief in another kind, and that was by seducing his ambitious and active Instruments to disturb the peace of the Church with damnable doctrines, and he found a choice Servant to promote this designe, <hi>Arius</hi> Presbyter of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> whether he was moved to do mischief out of hatred of his Bishop <hi>Alexander,</hi> or out of ambition, &amp; an itching humor to make innovations, or vain ostentation of his subtle wit, or for what other cause he was moved, the Lord knows; for certain, he introduced a new Doctrine, that Christ was only a Creature, and of him <hi>Constantine</hi> speaketh, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth a Verse of <hi>Homer</hi> to him:</p>

            <p>After the death of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and his happy exchange of a corruptible for an immortall Crown of Glory, the sparke of Arianisme under <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour of the East, was kindled into a flame, and this was that pernitious Doctrine which the Serpent cast out of his
<pb facs="tcp:118911:4"/>mouth, as a floud after the woman, the Catholique Church to drowne her, <hi>Revel.</hi> 12.15. nor was this wicked and malicious attempt without great success, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by that famous Dialogue betwixt that Hereticall Emperour and <hi>Liberius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning great and blessed <hi>Athanasius;</hi> the whole world (saith he) hath given sentence of his impiety. thou alone dost imbrace communion with that wicked Man, and disturbe the peace of the whole Church; whereunto the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> at the time answered both truly and resolutely, The word of Faith is not made one jot the worse by my being alone. <hi>Theodor. Eccles. Histor. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. And <hi>Modestinus,</hi> a Governour under <hi>Valens,</hi> another Arian Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour durst triumphantly boast to Saint <hi>Gregory Nazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anzen;</hi> What dost thou thinke (saith he) that thou alone canst resist? the rest are for the Emperour, and durst thou alone despise him? <hi>Gregor. Nazian. in Monod.</hi> It is true, as the same Authour speaketh in the life of Saint <hi>Basile,</hi> that <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Basile,</hi> and a few eminent stout Champions of Christ were as bright sparks kept alive, when he lived to see the multitude of the whole world, vvhich had received and professed the Gospel to be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Sects and Heresies, and which is to be wondred at, at last <hi>Liberius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and <hi>Hosius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Corduba</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> that famous and old experienced Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier of Christ, and the greatest number, either through feare, flattery, penury, simplicity, were carried away vvith that tempestuous Whirlewinde, which extorted this complaint from <hi>Jerome</hi> more then once, That the whole vvorld groaned, and wondred that it vvas become Arian, <hi>lib. de viris illust. Fortunatian.</hi> and <hi>lib. contra Lucife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianos;</hi> and to him Saint <hi>Austin</hi> accords, saying; The godly vvhich were most eminent vvere banished, and the rest in
<pb facs="tcp:118911:4"/>the vvhole vvorld lay hid, <hi>Epistola</hi> 48. But this mist which for a time obscured the glory of the Church, vvas ere long scattered by the Truth, vvhich shined forth most brightly, when the earth, the multitude of believers, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.16. in their Synods, and by their Writings helped the Church, and swallowed up the Floud, that pestilent Doctrine, as the earth doth vvater, and the Worthies of the Lord like Thunderbolts did confound those Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiques, so that they coul dnot in many generations lift up their heads to prevaile any more in that kind, yet was the holy Doctrine, and pure Worship by degrees much corrupted, both vvith unwarrantable additions of mens devising, and vvith idolatrous and superstitious practises, and the further you go from the Fountaine, you shall find the streame more muddy and defiled, insomuch that the better sort much mourned to see the pollutions in Gods House in their dayes, and both longed, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly prayed unto God for a Reformation.</p>
            <p>As in the time of the first Preaching of the holy Gospel to all Nations, vvhen the Husbandman sowed good seede, the Envious Man sowed tares, to discredit the holy Truth: so also when new Light burst forth in these latter dayes, vvhen <hi>Luther,</hi> and many Worthies were raised by God to reforme the Church over-spread vvith Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrins, as was foretold, especially by Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> Satan had his Apostles also, vvhich taught damnable Doctrines, and (vvhich is the cursed fruit of sinfull Toleration) largely transfused their <hi>Socinian</hi> ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome in <hi>Transilvauta, Polonia,</hi> and the Provinces subject to that Crown; to say nothing of many vvilde Opinions in <hi>Germany,</hi> and other places vvhich retarded much that blessed vvork of purging the Church from all pollutions: but, if I am not mistaken, a known professed <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi>

I instance only in the Anti-trinitarians, which have done the Devil great service in dishonouring the Lord of Glory, and have not only corrupt judgements, but do argue also for a creature Christ only, yea, and do preach their blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies against Him, and which is the height of impuden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, do expose in Print to the publike view their Hellish Herefies, such are <hi>Paul Best,</hi> Mr. <hi>Frie,</hi> Mr. <hi>Knowls,</hi> Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> and others I feare, which I have not heard of: these men are not worthy the name of Christians, as <hi>Athanasius</hi> faith of the Arians, that they are not to be called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, <hi>Orat.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2, and <hi>Liberius</hi> when he had stoutly pleaded for <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and refused gifts offered to him by the Emperour, said to a great man, Go thou thy ways and become a Christian, <hi>Theodoret. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Eccles.

            <p>Those that are fervent in Spirit, me thinks, should imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate that glorious Martyr <hi>Polycarpus,</hi> who was a Disciple of S. <hi>John,</hi> of whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Scholar saith, if he had heard any such blasphemies, he would have stopt his ears, and as his custome was, have said, <hi>Good God! to what times hast thou reserved me, that I should heare such blasphemies?</hi> and he would not have stayd in that place where he had

Is this the fruit of that vast expence of treasure, and of the spilling of an Ocean of blood for Religion, as was pretended, and for our Laws? Is this religiously to keep the late Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Protestation and National Covenant? Is this acceptably to praise God for his owning our Armies, as is professed, and crowning them, as it is famously known, with great successe, and many Victories? I do humbly conceive, that if this Land had been before these dayes, pestred with such hurtfull Beasts (as somtimes it was with Wolves) the Governours which have the rule over us, should for Gods sake, their own, and the Churches good, have taken, not onely the old Foxes, but the little Foxes, that they might not without controle destroy the tender Grapes of our Vine; but if we looke back to by gone yeares, and recount with our selves, that there was not, I believe, till these daies of trouble, the least number of professed <hi>Socinians</hi> in all the Land, and now may hear of many of these, and swarmes in some places of Schismatiques and Heretiques, this is, and ought to be for a lamentation. I wish that our Rulers would have laid to their hearts, and considered the practise of great <hi>Amphilochius,</hi> who requested the Emperor <hi>Theodosius</hi> to banish the <hi>Arians,</hi> which spoke ill of Christ, from the City of <hi>Constantinople</hi> and other Cities: but when he perceived that he set light by his motion, having taken a sit time pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posely, when <hi>Arcadius</hi> his Son sat in Councel with his Father <hi>Theod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Very commendable was the zeale of the primitive Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, which would not suffer corrupt Teachers, as Thieves to break into the Fold, and steale away the sheep, but as watchfull Dogs, they would bark and give faire warning to the sheep, and if possibly they could, skare away the Thieves, and as the industrious Historians say to maintain the integrity of the holy faith, they did not only pour out their prayers with groans to God, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent &amp; remove Heresies; but they openly declared against such Priests, they confuted them, and with their grave Writings they condemned them, which were strengthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned also by the consent and subscriptions of many pious Fathers: for as they truly say, impudent lies are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed with silence and dissembling, nor is the Divel over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and chased away by a sinful suffering him to do mischiefe without contradiction.</p>
            <p>I have heartily wished, and I doubt not but many thousands of Christians well affected to the truth do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with me in my desire, that some eminent Servants of God which have great abilities, and which are in respect of their gifts, higher then their brethren, as <hi>Saul</hi> was in sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the shoulders and upwards, and which have both leasure and store of Books at hand to furnish them, would put forth their strength for Gods glory, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of erroneous Spirits, and the clearing up of divine truths, and to encounter with heretical Authors: if these mighty ones would undertake the quarrel, which for ought I know is not yet done by them, I do conceive it might be said of their Writings, as <hi>Abishai,</hi> if they would smite them but once, neither they themselves, nor
<pb facs="tcp:118911:6"/>any others should have any need to smite them the second time.</p>
            <p>Truly this is a matter of high concerment, the Deity of Gods Son is denied, true Divinity is overturned, the faith of many is shaken, salvation is lost, and horrible impiety, to the griefe of the godly, is pieced out of infamous, and long since condemned Heresies; if these valiant Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of the Lord (and a thousand such may be found in <hi>England</hi>) would by the Sword of the Spirit and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Gods Word in their hands, set themselves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these growing evils, and as <hi>Aaron</hi> when the plague was begun, stand betwixt the living and the dead, they would be a Buckler to Gods people to keep off these poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonful darts of their Enemies from hurting them, which are too much neglected by them. These experienced Souldiers probably have not entred the Lists, partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they in modesty put it off from themselves to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and do think that such an one is fitter for the work then themselves; or partly because they think the business concerns others more then themselves: or, which is more likely, because the Writings of these Adversaries are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them, &amp; they are in their judgments, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> is the truth, vain, &amp; froathie, &amp; of no solidity; but I wish they would seriously consider, that it hath been a great honour to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the ancient Fathers to write against those enemies which had lesse to speak for themselves then the subtile Heretiques have which live in our dayes, as against the Pagans, and those of the Jewish Religion, and all sorts of Heretiques, though some of them were but of a meancal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as <hi>Hermogenes</hi> was a Painter, against whom <hi>Tertullian</hi> wrote, as appeares at the end of the Booke. And besides the great service they should do for God and his Church
<pb facs="tcp:118911:7"/>in standing up for the defence of the sacred Truth, I do conceive they would be no losers thereby, but by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious perpending of the holy Scriptures alledged by the Adversaries, they would have a clearer insight into them, and a deeper impression of them in their memories, then perhaps they have at present, besides their great reward from the Lord for their zealous labours: but now when this work is done by such a weake Instrument as my self, Truth shines not forth with such a bright luster, the Enemy is not so clearly convinced, and his mouth stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped from gaine-saying, nor are the seducers, and sedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in that faire probability to be reclaimed, or the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of Truth so fully satisfied, as all these would have been succesfully done, if these Worthies of the Lord had shewed themselves in the Field with their Armes in this Cause of God.</p>
            <p>I do confess the place of my Nativity was a great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to me to study Controversies from my youth; and when I came fresh from the Universities of <hi>Cambridge</hi> was unexpectedly surprized by a daring Jesuite, my Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary and Schoole-Fellow, as I heare, and in a manner forced to plead for Truth against Popish errours, and when a good part of some yeares had been spent in those Studies, and I had sufficiently tired my selfe and my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versarie, and his silence had put a seasonable period to those cumbursome, and in comparison unprofitable Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; I hoped then that I should spend the remainder of my dayes without distraction from that weighty imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which did more properly belong unto me, I mean, the comfortable discharge of my Ministery: twenty years and upwards were run out from that time, before I saw Mr. <hi>Biddles</hi> twelve Arguments against the Deity of the
<pb facs="tcp:118911:7"/>Holy Ghost, and as I verily believe, I was moved by Gods exciting grace to examine them, and my utmost in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions were then to add something to a Discourse, <hi>viz.</hi> a piece of a Sermon which I had on that sacred subject; but by the perswasion of some learned friends they were published, and I see no reason yet, why I should repent of those labours. This present yeare Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> hath printed again those twelve Reasons, and hath taken no notice either of my Answer, or Dr. <hi>Cloppingburgs</hi> to them: he shall give me leave to guesse at his Reasons; to these he hath added a Preface against the most glorious Trinity, and six Articles of his faith, tending for the most part to disprove the Deity of our blessed Saviour: these, though I never saw them, nor so much as heard of them, were (as he saith) printed in the yeare of Grace 1648. but are much inlarged in this Edition.</p>
            <p>I have been incouraged by learned mens approbation of my former Treatise, once again in my old age to trie the strength of Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> and by the good hand of God with mee, have finished my Answer to the whole; I have omitted nothing of moment, and I have been very sparing to alledge the testimonies of the ancient and later Writers, which might easily have been done, and have made those cited by me for the most part to speak English, being carefull to represent the meaning, though not the very words of the Authors, and as <hi>Luther</hi> speaks, reconciling the Evangelist <hi>Matthew</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Esa.</hi> on <hi>Matth:</hi> 12. they do differ (saith he) onely <hi>sono Grammatico,</hi> but they do agree <hi>tono Theologico:</hi> and this have I done for no other end, but that the bulk of the Book might not grow too big under my hands.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:118911:8"/>
            <p>I am not so far in love of my labours, nor so ambitious to appear in Print, as simply to desire to have them come into the light, but I do cordially submit them to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my learned and religious brethren; and whiles they hang in the birth, neither born nor buried, I do hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily desire them which shall peruse these unpolished lines, for Gods sake, for Christs honour, and for the sake of Religion, and the Sons of the Church, to passe their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiall censure; and if they shall think fit to strangle them in the womb, it shall be no griefe at all to me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very willing that all my labours should rather perish, then the honour of my Saviour should be in the least de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree Eclipsed through my weakness; and I would be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad to hear that a more able Pen was set on work for the vindication of Gods honour exceedingly debased by a sinful man: but if they shall judge them to be in any measure conducing to the opening of the great mystery of godliness, God manifested in the flesh, I shall neither be unwilling nor ashamed to make them publick; but my Prayers to God are, that his blessing may fall on the heads and the hearts of the Readers, whose prayers he doth earnestly crave in the words of S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 15.30. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you Brethren, for the Lord Jesus Christ his sake, and for the love of the Spirit, strive in your Prayers that he may keep the faith, and finish his course with joy,</hi> who is</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N these our dayes we see, to our great griefe, that many which were in times past Members of our Church, have proved Schismaticks and Revol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the true Religion, and are not only men of corrupt judgments, but have steeled their fore-heads to publish with confidence their blasphemous dotages. Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi> is a prime man in this infamous rank, and a Ringleader of the Samosatenian and Macedonian Hereticks, and pleads in print with all his skill for a Creature-Christ and a Creature Holy Ghost; and he also, to the great dishonour of God the Father, denies his Ubiquity and infallible prescience of
<pb facs="tcp:118911:11"/>future contingencies, and is justly charged with many more execrable Heresies. Nor have his Writings been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>closed within the confines of our Nation, but have taken their wings and have fled beyond the Seas, to the disrepu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of our dear Country in the Reformed Churches, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somuch that <hi>Marecsius,</hi> Professour of Divinity at <hi>Groningen,</hi> a City which gives denomination to one of the seventeen Provinces, is bold to avouch, I do not say either truly or charitably, that Socinianisme hath fixed its metrapolitical Seat here in <hi>England,</hi> and displayed openly the Banners of its Impiety.</p>
            <p>I have some years by gone held forth an Antidote against the poison of his twelve Reasons against the Deity of the Holy Ghost, and I hope, not without all successe; since the publishing of those Arguments, he hath as is usually seen in deceivers, growne worse and worse, and levied his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces against the Holy Trinity, and the Deiety of our blessed Saviour. And although I am in many respects unfit to deal with Polemical Authors; yet not hearing that an able Pen hath undertaken this task to answer this Treatise, I have once again appeared in the Field against this most subtle Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, as <hi>Nicholas Arnoldus</hi> Professour of Divinity at <hi>Frane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker</hi> in <hi>West-Friesland,</hi> acknowledgeth him to be; and by the good hand of God upon me, have finished my Answer to whatsoever is material in it; and not relying on my owne judgment, I have intreated some Divines, which are eminent for Piety and Learning, to peruse it, and passe an impartial censure upon it, which they have so far approved, that they have encouraged me to expose it to publick view. And I am glad that I have a fit opportunity to make an open ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment with all thankfulnesse to your Honour of one Signal and Eminent Favour (to omit all the rest) vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed to me, and which was so much more acceptable,
<pb facs="tcp:118911:11"/>as it was altogether unexpected, by meanes whereof a great Storme was averted from me, and I have to this day enjoyed the free exercise of my Ministerial Function where Divine Providence placed me. An Oath is a most Sacred Tye, and a high part of the Service of our Great and Holy God; and although it be lawful in it selfe, yet if it be not apprehended to be lawful by him to whom it is tendred, that man without question must run any hazard rather then staine and disquiet his conscience with the guilt thereof; and this merciful act, I hope, was neither displeasing to God, nor a ground of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance either to your Honour or those worthy Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, which were perswaded by you not to presse me with the publick Obligation of the National Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant.</p>
            <p>I humbly crave leave to deal freely and faithfully with your Honour according to my duty, in reference to your eternal happinesse. Yet I must request the Reader, that no illogical consequences be obtruded on me, from what I shall write, to infer, That I conceive, you are destitute of Heavenly Graces, to which you are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. No such matter: for there is no man that belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth in God, feareth, loveth and honoureth him, but he may be excited to believe on him, to fear, love and honour him; to this end, that he may use all holy means, sincerely and constantly, that heavenly Graces may not be weakned, and in the least degree impaired, and that they may be gradually intended, and more deeply rooted in his immortal soul.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath given you a large portion of outward Riches, and it is the Counsel of the Holy Ghost, which you ought to follow, not to set your heart on them, for they are external, transitory, unsatisfying Blessings, and
<pb facs="tcp:118911:12"/>common to the worst of men; and had you a greater Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure then <hi>Solomon</hi> laid out in building the glorious Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in the Furniture thereof; yea, if you possessed Mountaines of Gold and Silver, yet doth not your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse consist in these things: the favour of God, pardon of sins, and Saving Graces with Poverty, are incomparably better then all the Riches in the world; but he requireth that you should make a returne of proportionable thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse and sincere obedience to him, and to exercise libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral beneficence unto the poor Saints, and to pious uses.</p>
            <p>Nor hath the Lord only bestowed Riches upon you, but Honour also, and ranked you amongst the Great Men of this world; Seek, I beseech you, chiefly to be great and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in the eyes of the Lord, and great in the hearts of his servants, and then you have a fair Prospect to the best Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; at length you shall be as great as you can desire to be, and in the mean time have more solid Greatnesse, Honour and Reverence, then the Greatest men in the world, which are unholy and unjust, can have; which as the ancient No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of <hi>Rome,</hi> may deservedly weare Moones on their shooes, as <hi>Plutark</hi> writeth; which are a lively Embleme of mutability.</p>
            <p>God hath blessed you also with Stately and Sumptuous Buildings, be you sure to lay the foundation on the Rock Christ; If men ask (saith <hi>Chrysostom</hi>) why do such and such men build fair houses? it will be answered, to preserve an immortal memory; and that such houses may be called the houses of such Great men; but this is not (saith the golden mouth, <hi>Homil.</hi> 30 <hi>in Genes.</hi>) to procure credit but discredit to themselves: for you shall hear words of many contumelies; This house belongs to this man, to this cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous man, to this Robber of Widowes and Orphanes, to this Extortioner. If you desire to have an eternal name and
<pb facs="tcp:118911:12"/>memory, the way to procure it, is to be enamoured with the Celestial <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which is above, and not made with mortal hands; it is to make your Sumptuous Buildings to be the Churches of Christ, and entertain him in your best Rooms: Provide for eternity by that which is transitory, and this wil be the most compendious way to solid prosperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the perpetuity of your Family. And touching all outward things, my hearts desire to God is, that you may from a truly enlightned judgement say with Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which was in her a commendable speech, <hi>I set more by the salvation of my soul, then by ten Kingdomes,</hi> Fox To. 3. pag. 221.</p>
            <p>Besides, the Lord hath not placed you in the low condition of a servant, to be at the command of others; but he hath honoured you with the Title of a Master over many servants. Let holy <hi>Davids</hi> resolution be a standing rule to you, to walk with an upright heart in the midst of your house, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, encourage, and reward those that are vertuous and of an unblamea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I may not forget to put your Honour in mind of that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary and excellent Duty of a Christian, to be adorned with Faith, and to live by Faith in all conditions. Let nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your Children, nor your Riches, nor Honours, nor frowns, nor flatteries of men keep you one hour from the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed and sweet communion with Jesus Christ; let your soul be so ravished with his transcendent Beauty, that in some De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree you may say with <hi>Elzear</hi> Count of <hi>Arran,</hi> (my Author is <hi>Sales</hi>) if my godly wife <hi>Delphina,</hi> if any one will seek me,
<pb facs="tcp:118911:13"/>he shall find me (in the assiduous Meditation) on the wounds of my blessed Saviour. And with that Honorable Confessor and Sufferer for Christ, <hi>Galeacius,</hi> One hours communion with Jesus Christ, is better then all the world. My Lord, All the spiritual sweetnesse of a Christian, is derived from his bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and the life of the soul is from his bloudy death: To enjoy him, is a Heaven upon Earth, and when outward Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings do flow to you from the fountain of his blood, they are then indeed, as a field which God hath blessed. I add, That this will make you to live above all Creature comforts, and to be truly happy without the happinesse of the world; this will be a cordial and a mighty supporter in the saddest affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and in the approach of death, the King of terrors; this will make you active for the honour of our blessed Saviour, who hath fulfilled the Law, and suffered the Curse due to you, for your salvation.</p>
            <p>Above all, my Lord, be careful whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, to do all to the glory of God: all other ends in all Actions, Natural, Civil, Moral and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious must be subordinate to this highest end, which ought to be as the Master-wheel of a Clock, to set the inferiour wheeles on work. An Action may glitter in the eyes of men, yet if Gods glory be not stamped on it, it is counterfeit met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and no Coyn for the Lords Treasury, its not currant and approved in the Court of Heaven; 'tis as a fair body with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a head, as <hi>Lactantius</hi> speaks: 'tis a dead work, and wants that which is the principal. Godlinesse, as it is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from Holinesse, is required hereunto, and it is a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine impression on the soul, whereby it hath a tendency to God, as light bodies do ascend upward: Although no credit nor profit would redound to a godly man thereby; yet he who is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, Godly and Religious, will move to God, as his Center and ultimate perfection. To move you effectually
<pb facs="tcp:118911:13"/>to act for God, frequently call to mind the glorious Majesty, and the transcendent Excellency of our great God, and this will be a heavenly Load-stone to attract your soul with great delight and contentment to draw nigh to him, and think al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so what great things he hath done for you; both your natural and your gracious being are from him, and when your soul is put into an excellent frame, and beutified with the Image of God, yet it is like to an artificial Jack, which moves not at all, not to a supernatural end, without the weight of his exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting grace, to give you a Will to work according to that Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural Principle, nor to affect without his co-operating grace what you do will, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. And therefore as wise <hi>Solomon</hi> saith of Rivers, <hi>They come from the Sea, and return back into the Sea;</hi> So let it be with your Honour, as all the good you have comes from God as the efficient cause, so let him have the honour of all as the final cause thereof.</p>
            <p>I have no more at present to trouble your Honour withal, only my Prayers shall be to our gracious God for your true and solid happinesse, and the happinesse of all your dear rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and do intreat you to accept of this Dedication, and to continue your favour to the Author, who is</p>

               <p>Our good God at sundry times and in divers manners <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. gratiously revealed to his beloved Ones those divine Truths which were necessary for their Salvation, and it is not denied by us, but readily assented to, that since the Apostacy of our first Parents from God and their own happiness, innumerable multitudes revolted from the purity of Worship practised by <hi>Adam</hi> in his own person, and which he carefully taught his Children to yeild as an Homage to the great God, who is the first Author and principall End of all things: And this unhappily fell out partly through the strong delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of that cunning and malicious Adversary the Devil, partly through their own deceivable lusts, in pleasing themselves, and their fellow-creatures, and partly by their Religion, relying on their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, which since the fall of man is much blinded; and as the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopher saith, is like the Owle which cannot behold the lustre of that lovely Creature the Sun, the glorious and mysterious Truths disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the word of truth.</p>
               <p>The holy Scriptures do attest to this historicall Truth; for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; the generality of people before the great Flood were defiled, and when the Beesom of Gods wrath had swept that Generation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and drowned them all in the over-flowing waters, only <hi>Noah</hi> and his Family were mercifully and miraculously kept alive; yet see mans mutability, their Issue was in a short time corrupted with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, and not only the Posterity of <hi>Japhet</hi> and <hi>Cham,</hi> but of blessed <hi>Sem</hi> also, soon turned their backs on God, and ungraciously refused to walk with God, as their Father <hi>Noah</hi> to his eternall ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour had wisely done; and when God in mercy in that generall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption had made choice of <hi>Abrahams</hi> feed to be his peculiar people, and suffered all others to be guided by their own blind imagination, yet how prone they were to provoke the holy eyes of God to jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie, by their adulterous carriage both when they were in <hi>Aegypt, Ezech.</hi> 20.8. when they were in the Wilderness in their passage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the holy Land, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32. and when they were possessed of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> lamentbale experience doth plainly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
               <p>Thus far I see no cause why we should not agree with you. Nor do we deny but the like inconstancy is found in some, though not in all, nor at all times in the generality of the Professors of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:118911:15"/>Religion, for in the Apostles daies, which were happy Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to spread the light of the Gospel in all known Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; there were some that made shipwrack of faith, and denied the Resurrection of the body, and blessed <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 20. foretels that ravenous Wolves after his departure would arise from amongst themselues, which would not spare the Flock of Christ: and before the death of S. <hi>John,</hi> the longest lived Apostle, the Devil raised up <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> from whom the <hi>Ebionites</hi> sprung, as good men were called <hi>pauperes de Lugduno</hi> as our learned <hi>Junius</hi> hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served; <hi>Ebion</hi> was not (he saith) the proper name of a man, but signifies a man as poor in his outward condition, so poor likewise in his Intellectuals, as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> descants on his name: These Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants held that <hi>Christ</hi> was only a man, and not God, both to stop and confute that Heresie, S. <hi>John</hi> wrote his Gospel, as <hi>Irenaeus l.</hi> 1. <hi>advers. haereses c.</hi> 25. <hi>Hierom in Catalogo Scriptor.

Epiphanius,</hi> and others, as is to be seen in the Catalogue of the foresaid Hereticks; and I do further grant, as an undeniable truth made good by this and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer age, that notwithstanding the decisions of the holy Scriptures, and the determinations of venerable Synods. <hi>Arius</hi> and <hi>Samosate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> are unhappily revived, and many deluded Spirits are guilty of making defection from the true God, yea, and they are so obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly bent to walk in crooked waies, that except our gracious God interposeth by his mighty power to change their hearts, tis not

               <p>That which you add concerning <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> in imitation of your Symmists, that albeit they reformed much, yet the gross opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Trinity, as you blaspheme, is embraced by them, and that it lying at the bottom, corrupteth almost all our Religion. Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing these Worthies of the Lord, I say, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> did of <hi>Calvin, l. de Christo. Ʋtinam sio semper erraret Calvinus.</hi> I do wish the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Antichristians would alwaies, and in all other Controversies so erre, as they do in the Doctrine of the Trinity, and your bare and positive assertion, that Romish corruptions in faith and practice, are deduced from that sublime and mysterious Article, as it is unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously maintained by Protestants and them, is made good by no better reason then to say darkness is drawn out of light, cold out of fire, and corrupt water out of a pure Fountain. This, Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> which you peremptorily avouch, should have been soundly proved, and not as if it had been an Oracle dictated to us, demonstrate, if you can in your next, any Popish Error which is fitly built on that rocky foundation. I do differ from you, and am confident, that this holy Mystery was received as a divine truth in the Church of Christ, before Popery had any being in the World, and that it is religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously embraced in this, and the former age, where these defiling pollutions are wasted away. I do see that you are a true Son of the Anti-trinitarians your Progenitors, which were wont in the pride of their own proceedings to glory before the Victory, as it is to be seen in a Table drawn by themselves. My Witness is <hi>Bellar. praefat. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Christo,</hi> that the Roman Church is like a great ruinous Building: <hi>Luther</hi> with his followers sits at the top therof, and they do throw down the Tiles and the Roof. <hi>Zwinglius</hi> with his Sacramentarians do endeavour to cast down the Walls of the Popish Superstition, but the last and hardest work of all remained to be done by the hands of the <hi>Arians, Antitrinitarians,</hi> and such like, active Instruments of Satan, which being armed with Hammers, Mattocks, and such like Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of demolishing stately Buildings, do raze the very ground and foundation of Popery, meaning therby the Doctrine of the sacred Trinity, and the Divine Nature of our Saviour, which, <hi>Sathanusius</hi> (for so it pleased that impious forsaken Miscreant, black in name, and black in mind, <hi>Gregory Niger,</hi> and <hi>Valentinus Gentilis,</hi> as is related

I will therfore by the help of God examine his reasons which he is not ashamed to expose to our view to overthrow the unshaken Doctrine of the blessed Trinity.</p>

               <p>Christian Reader, that I may proceed methodically, and avoid confusion, and unnecessary explication of the same thing, which frequently occurs, I must take liberty to premise two conclusions, and open them for weaker judgments, as well as I can, these are needfull, and to be remembred throughout the whole discourse: they are commonly, I grant, in the mouths of all, but they are not well apprehended of the most, nor fully comprehended by any mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall man, no, nor by the most glorious Angels in Heaven, and the reason is invincible, for they are all of them finite, but our God is infinite, he cannot be seen, for he is <hi>Visu clarior, nec comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di,

               <p>The first Conclusion, There is but One God.</p>
               <p>The second Conclusion, this One God is distinguished into three Persons.</p>

But <hi>One</hi> here is taken to be a most single, singular, and perfect Unity, one in regard of the most simple and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible Essence, which is the most perfect way of being One, One in <hi>Ʋltima actualitate existens nec potest reddi magis singularis, nec per proprietates personales quoquo modo actuari &amp; determinari,</hi> for this implies a contradiction, and supposeth imperfection and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiality, which is inconsistent with the Deity, <hi>Scotus in</hi> 1. <hi>sent. dist.</hi> 5. <hi>quaest.</hi> 2.</p>

<label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>1</label> I will name but a few: 1. I do suppose that God is not finite but infinite in <hi>Essence Wisdom, Power,</hi> and that he alone is <hi>Jehovah</hi> the most High, <hi>Ps.</hi> 83 18. and therfore there is but one God; for if there were more then one, either they should be equally high, and then it could not truly be said of one of them, that he is the most high, and if one was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then another, it will follow, that he that is the highest <hi>God</hi> must needs alone be the only true <hi>God:</hi> or we may frame the Argument thus, it is not possible that there should be more then One infinite Beeing; for suppose there should be more then one, each of them should have some perfection peculiar <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o it self which is not in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but now certain it is that nothing is infinite which hath not infinite perfection, and which hath not a most perfect beeing.

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lustrate this point by letters: suppose <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> are two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite things, if <hi>A.</hi> be infinite, then hath it the highest perfection,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118911:18"/>and therfore includes all that perfection which is in <hi>B.</hi> for if it hath not all perfection, then the want of that perfection makes it to be imperfect, and consequently that it is a finite beeing; but if it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes all the perfection of <hi>B.</hi> how can <hi>B.</hi> be distinguished from <hi>A.</hi> and by consequent there can be but one infinite being, the supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many Infinites is the destruction of them all.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, If there be many Gods, then either they must needs be subordinate, and one of them under another, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles subordinated their inferior Gods to their great <hi>Jupiter,</hi> or else they must be Coordinate; first, of equall dignity, power, and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, not the former, for in causes subordinate, the inferior hath a more limited power then the superior, and hereupon we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that these inferior Gods are falsely so called, and no Gods at all, for God is apprehended to have an illimited power of working, to be infinite and independent; not the latter, for then either the World could not be governed by one of them, but by them all joyntly, then the finite power in them singly, proves them to be no Gods at all, or if they be able, and by consent do divide the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the World amongst them; there can no reason be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven why they should be multiplied, and better this is performed by one infinite God, then by many, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, And if there be more divine Natures then one, it implies no contradiction that one God should be at difference with another, and have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary wills, then which nothing can be more absurd.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As God is the first Efficient of all things, so is he the last end of all, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.4. and therfore there is but one God, for if there were more then one, there would be more then one prime cause, and one last end of all things, and they should be all of them referred to one, and then the alone is the true God, or else they are not refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to him, and then none of them should be the last end of all things, which is contradicted by Scripture. There is no need to add any more Testimonies or Reasons, when we and our Adversaries do joyntly agree, there cannot be any more then one God.</p>

The sense then is this, the Lord our God who is more then one in personality, is yet but one in essentiality. But there is no necessity to alledge obscure testimonies, we have a plain proof which is beyond excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and contradiction in our imitation to visible Christianity, in our admission into the Church, where this mystery is placed in the fore-front, written in great capitall letters, in the form of Baptism appointed by our blessed Saviour: we are baptized IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER, OF THE SON, AND OF THE HOLY GHOST: so that our Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion depends upon the acknowledgement of this great mystery, and to deny this were not only to fall into Herisie, but in effect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Christianity.</p>
               <p>For the better understanding of this sublime Article of Faith,
<note place="margin">What is a Person.</note> it is necessary to know what a Person is: take notice that the word Person is taken here in a a restrained theological notion, and may be thus defined:</p>
               <p>A Person is an individuall subsistence in an inte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ectuall nature, or a singular incommunicable thing that subsisteth by it self in a nature indued with understanding.</p>
               <p>First, to the being of a Person, it is necessary that the thing which we call Person, be by nature indued with understanding, I say not with reason, for this properly belongs to men, <hi>Rad: contra Scot: contra</hi> 22. <hi>l.</hi> 2. otherwise it is not a Person. But Angels are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat substances, and properly so called Persons. To use a familiar instance; who will or can truly say of twenty Horses or Sheep, or any creatures of the like kind, that there are twenty persons? but if twenty Men, Women and Children are met together, we do usually and truly say, twenty persons are assembled together.</p>
               <p>Secondly we must know that the word Person signifies some indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduall of that kind, and not many collectively or considered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for it is unreasonable to say, that the fore-mentioned men which are many in number, though they have use of Reason, are one
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:118911:19"/>person; therefore we mean by person any one singular of that kind: every Man, every Woman, and every Child is a Person, because eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of these is indued with reason &amp; understanding, &amp; is distinct by himself from all others, so that no other Man, Woman, or Child in all the world is, or can be the said Person. I adde, that such qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities as can no where be found where Reason is not, as Justice, Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, Temperance, and such like, yet are not a Person, because they being accidents are not entire of themselves, but leave their being in a Person.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is required that a Person be incommunicable; it is true, that no singular thing can be communicated, as <hi>genus</hi> and <hi>spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> are to inferior substances, it being it self an <hi>individuum;</hi> thus, and on this account the divine nature, though it be most singular, yet is it not a Person, because it hath a double communicability, as the School-men speak, it's communicated to the three divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, as <hi>quod,</hi> for every one of the divine Persons is the Deity, or God, and it is also communicated as <hi>quo,</hi> as the form whereby God is God, and every person is God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, that which is a part of another thing, is not a Person, as the body is not a Person, nor the soul, because the immortall soul was created to be a part of man, and therefore the immortall soul when it lives in a state of separation from the body is no Person, because (as I said) it was originally created to be a constituent part of a Person, and it hath an innate propension or naturall tendency to be reunited to the body; nor should the soul at any time have been seperated, or existed without the body, had it not been for the sin of Man, for death which is the dissolution of the parts, is a fruit of sin inherent or imputed, so that the state of seperation in it self considered, is a state of imperfection, and whether it be glorious or miserable, yet is it not so glorious or miserable, as it will be in the state of glorification, or destruction, of soul and body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united.</p>
               <p>Well then to the being of a Person, it is required in generall, that the thing called a Person be of such a kind, as is naturally indued with Reason or Understanding; more particularly, that it be one singular thing of that kind, and that it be such a thing as hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence by it self, and doth not depend upon any other as a part thereof, the hand of <hi>Plato</hi> is an <hi>individuum,</hi> not a Person, because it subsists not in it self, but in the <hi>totum,</hi> the whole, which is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118911:19"/>and excellent, &amp; on this ground also the humane nature of our Saviour is not a Person, because, it is as it were a part of the second Person of the Trinity, and subsists in the union of that divine Person.</p>
               <p>Now albeit there are many vast differences betwixt a created and an uncreated person, and there are no fewer then nine recited and learnedly discoursed on by Dr. <hi>Cheynel</hi> chap: 6. of the Trinity; yet in this they do agree, that the eternall Father, and the eternall Son of God, and the eternall Holy Ghost are three distinct persons one from another, and opposed one to another, not with an adverse, but a meer friendly and relative opposition, so that there is but one Father, one Son, and one Holy Ghost; neither is the Father predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of the Son, or Holy Spirit; nor the Son of God of his Father, or of the Holy Ghost; nor is the Holy Ghost predicated of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or of the Son of God, which proveth that every one of these blessed Persons hath its subsistence of it self, I say not from it self, and therefore are alledged as three witnesses in Heaven, 1. <hi>John</hi> 5.7. every one of these is a severall Person, and yet all three are but one infinite God, subsisting with all absolute and relative perfection, whence it will follow that we must according to the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in unity.</p>
               <p n="1">1. These three Persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially distinguished, but the divine Nature is one and the same in them all. Here is the glory of the mystery which dazles the eye of naturall Reason, the divine Person cannot be separated from the divine nature, or the d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vine nature from any one of the divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and therefore all the titles and attributes which do belong to God, do equally appertain to them all, as to be uncreated, eternall, Almighty: all these, and all the rest of this kind, which are in truth but one and the same infinite being, yet in regard of our weak capacities are apprehended as many, are common to all the three Persons; the Father is uncreated Almighty, and eternall; the Son of God is uncreated eternall, Almighty; the Holy Ghost is uncrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Eternal &amp; Almighty: &amp; the reason is, because the divine nature of all the three glorious Persons is one and the same, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence these divine Attributes are not really distinguished amongst themselves <hi>ratione ratiocinata,</hi> as School-men speak, when the minde of man in making a distinction of reason doth take an occasion from the different effects. Mercy and Justice are all one in God, and and they are no other then God himself, yet are there diversity of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118911:20"/>operations of God, as it is one action of God as terminated to the creature to punnish a sinner, and another different action of God to shew mercy on a sinner, here do we vertually distinguish these Attributes of God. His Justice and his Mercy, which <hi>a parte rei,</hi> are the same as <hi>vis califactiva &amp; excicativa</hi> of the Sun, is but one indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divisible quality, yet hath a double operation, one to heat, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to dry.</p>
               <p>Secondly, these divine Persons are not so distinguished, as that they really are, or can p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ssibly be seperated one from another, as created persons of necessity must be; so that these three as they are co-essentiall, so do they mutually subsist in one another without com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixtion, or confusion: <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.10. <hi>The Father is in the Son, and the Son of God in the Father:</hi> this is not only true in regard of the divine essence in which they do subsist, which is not only indivisible but infi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nite, for then the Father should be in himself if that was an ordinary reason hereof, which propriety of speech will not admit; nor is the relation alone the adequate cause of the inexistency of one divine Person in another, because the relations of originall are not of the same reason in reference to the Son of God, and the Holy Ghost: whereupon it follows, that they could not uniformly be one in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but the adequate reason hereof includes both, I mean the identity of essence with the relation, both these must concur: as in the creatures nothing is like it self, but similitude hath reference to another thing, yet similitude is founded upon the unity, to speak logically, which is in quality: the diversity of the relatives, or the alone unity of the foundation is not sufficient to denominate things to be like, but both must concur in that Argument.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, these three divine Persons are distinguished each from other: the Father is <hi>alius, non aliud a Filio:</hi> there are three reall Persons in the Godhead, and not three by a fiction of reason, but manifested to be three by plain Scripture, and they were three be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Scriptures were penned, and will continue three Persons to all eternity; nor is this distinction betwixt them grounded upon any offices or externall dispensations in reference to the Creatures, but they are distinguished by relations and personal properties truly before mans apprehension thereof; these are called by the School men notionall Attributes, because the divine Persons are made known and distinguished by them, and yet they are reall relations, and reall properties: I mean in opposition to the fiction of mans
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:118911:20"/>reason, this distinction makes not the essence of the Father another essence then the essence of the Son; nor is the divine essence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded, for then there would not be a Trinity, but a Quaternity of Persons, but the distinction is called <hi>formalis</hi> which is betwixt the essence and the Persons, and this lieth in the midst betwixt a distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction called reall, and that which is <hi>rationis ratiocinantis,</hi> made by mans reason; the divine essence is communicated to the person, but one person is not communicated to another. We may say the Person is the divine essence with a certain modification, or manner of subsisting: the incommunicable manner of subsisting, which each person hath proper to himself, is that by which they are distinguished, in all other things there is no reall difference of one person from another; nor are the divine persons simply distinguished by rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, albeit Divines do often so speak, for then there would be four Persons, sith there are confessedly four relations, <hi>viz. Pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas, Filatio, Spiratio activa,</hi> and <hi>processio:</hi> but they are distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by their personall properties, or the manner of subsisting, and when these are said to be distinguished by relations, it is not meant as they are relations, but properties, and the very names which are given to them in the word of God do point at the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which is betwixt them.</p>
               <p>The first Person hath the divine essence of himself, because as <hi>Scotus</hi> saith, there is nothing before the first Person by which it might be put there, but it is of it self immediatly in the first Person, and the Father is God, not because he is either begotten or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth, but because he hath the divine essence, which essence nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doth beget nor is begotten, nor doth it proceed; neither is there a greater essence in the Father begetting, then is in the Son begotten, and the reason is evident, because the essence is the same both in Father and Son: as the humane nature makes an <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duum</hi> to be a man whither he hath it by creation, or conveyed to him by generation. <hi>Adam</hi> was no more a man then <hi>Abel</hi> was, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit he had the human nature by creation, but <hi>Abel</hi> had it by genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The essence to speak properly is not the fountain of the Person or of the relation: Persons are produced of Persons, and Relations are not produced as they are Relations, but necessarily <hi>per se</hi> do follow the production of the persons. <hi>Aquinas</hi> 1. <hi>par: q:</hi> 4. <hi>act:</hi> 9.</p>
               <p>The Father then (to speak properly and plainly) begetteth not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:118911:21"/>the essence of his Son: but his Son in the divine essence; he doth communicate the divine essence to his Son by eternall generation, and neither is begotten nor proceedeth, consider we the Son as he is God, and nothing can be perceived to appertain to the Father, but it doth likewise belong to the Son of God, and the Holy Ghost, wherein then will you say lieth the difference betwixt them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. We do fully answer, the difference is in his manner of subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or in being the Son of the Father, who though he be neither made nor created by the Father, though he hath not <hi>principium ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiale,</hi> as <hi>Junius</hi> speaks, yet hath he <hi>principium originale,</hi> he is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by him, and so as he is the Son of God, he hath not his being of himself, but from his Father, and therefore in the manner of his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting, is really distinguished from the Father.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In like manner the Holy Ghost is distinguished both from the first and second Person, because he neither begetteth, nor is begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, but proceedeth, and is breathed, as it were, both from the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son, not as from two distinct principles, but as from one: in this regard albeit he agrees with the Son, in that each of them hath his being from a third, I mean from the first person of the sacred Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, yet in the particular māner of his being he is distinguished from him, for he is not begotten as is the Son, but proceeds both from the Father and the Son, it is in expresse terms of Scripture said, that <hi>he proceeds from the Father, John</hi> 15.26. and therefore is called <hi>the Spirit of the Father, Mat:</hi> 10.20. now that he also proceeds from the Son of God though it be not in so many terms expressed, yet is soundly inferred, not only because our Saviour saith, <hi>all things that the Father hath are mine, John</hi> 16.13.14.15. therefore said I, the Spirit shall take off mine, and shew it to you; but more plainly because he is called the <hi>Spirit of Christ, Rom:</hi> 8.9. and <hi>the Spirit of the Son of God Gal:</hi> 4.6. as well as of the Father.</p>
               <p>Thus have I with as much brevity as I could, set down a short collection out of Authors, of all kinds, of the divine mystery which is sufficient for my purpose: if a man desires a fuller opening hereof, let him use the learned and elaborate Treatise of Dr. <hi>Cheynel,</hi> the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Trin-unity, written in our Mother tongue where he may find full satisfaction.</p>

               <p>The Trinity of Persons introduceth three Gods, say you; but how this is proved? by an Argument drawn from similitude: as <hi>Peter, James,</hi> &amp; <hi>John</hi> are three Men; so Father, Son, &amp; Holy Ghost are three Gods, the consequence is impious, and therefore the Trinity which introduceth three Gods is not to be admited, to this I answer, it is a received rule comparison, in generall, and particular similitudes have a good use for illustration, but not for a solid confirmation of a controverted truth, I answer distinctly to this specious argument (which may perhaps startle an ignorant man) by denying this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, if <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are three men, then Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are three Gods, this consequence I say is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, and there is in the proof <hi>fallacia similium,</hi> three men are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be like the Trinity, when they are most unlike▪ there is not the same reason of the Creatures and of God, mark the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, there is one generall nature common to all men, whereby they are men, and so are they men, as that every <hi>individuum</hi> is a severall man. <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are three men, as well as three persons, but the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not three Gods, though they be three Persons distinctly subsisting, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son thereof is evident, taken from that vast difference which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the nature of God and Man: the nature of man is finite, and therefore it may be multiplyed into severall men of the same kind, and this neither is, nor can be denied, but the nature of God being most simple and infinite, is altogether indivisible, and cannot possibly admit of many infinites. <hi>Peter, James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> are one <hi>in specie,</hi> in kind, but Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not one <hi>in specie,</hi> but in regard of the same most singular essence, not to be abstracted from the three Persons, and this essence is of none: for then God should be <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>To this I answer, reason that is our understanding left to it self, and not inlightned and guided by the Holy Ghost, is a blind Guide in these high mysteries, and a great Patroness of unbelief to wrangle against them; nor can we, no nor holy Angels (as is confessed by naturall demonstration) prove the distinction of Persons in God, and the School-mens ground is very strong, because our knowledge of God this way is by the effects, I mean by the creatures of God, by them we may learn that God is the Prime and first cause, and ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate end of the Creatures, which are cōmon to all the holy persons, according to that most certain and received Rule. The works of the Trinity in reference to the Creatures are undivided, and in regard of the things themselves, there can be gathered no difference, and if we make an impossible supposition, if there was but one divine Person, yet the whole Creation would have stood up out of nothing frō that one, as it doth now from them all: nor do we expect a parallel exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to illustrate this point in the whole Creation, to which exceptions may not be taken, for this one undivided essence, in which these three glorious and ever to be adored persons, do subsist; is an infinite essence, and confessedly there can be but one infinite, they then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt have a misguided reason, which do bring an instance from men to overthrow this sublime mystery, which is too high for the weak part and condition of frail man to understand: our reason then acts most rationally, when it piously submits to the unquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable revelation of God in his Word, who is the prime verity, and if we meet with such a knot which our reason cannot unty, the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of faith believing the unerring Word, cuts assunder; and as the unity of the Godhead is clear to the eye of reason, so the three g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now albeit the mystery of the Trinity is not demonstrated by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall reason,

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:118911:22"/>the most simple and uncompounded being would lose its being, and of simple would be compounded: they all three do signifie one and the same being, though they differ in the manner of signifying it; nor is one of these predicated of another, truth is not goodness, nor for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally one, and every one of these affections do connote entity, &amp; do not superadde a new entity, but <hi>ens</hi> as it is considered with reference to the act of understanding, is called true, as in reference to the will, is called good, as it denied division in it self, it is called one, semblably neither are the divine Persons predicated one of another, the Father is not the Son, nor are they separated one from another, nor do the three divine Persons superadde a new entity to God: If I (saith a reverend Divine) should take out of a River severall cups full of water, surely there is no difference in the nature of the water, but as it is distinct in severall cups or vessels, which gives it severall terms and severall dimensions: again, this mystery is compared to the Sun in the firmament, where we may observe heat, light, and motion, three distinct and severall things, the heat from the light, and the conveyance of it to us by the motion, yet all have alike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of being, not one before or after another, and all of them alike partaking in one and the same nature and essence of the Sun. But why should I make a compound of substances and qualities, when this mystery may be more fully expressed by spirituall substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces? which as they come nearer, so do they better resemble the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Deity. I instance in the soul and its faculties, if they are (as <hi>Scotus</hi> and his followers, <hi>Zanchius</hi> and <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and others do maintain) one thing, for then there is not a reall composition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the soul and the faculties of it: memory in the soul is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the knowledge begotten in it, and so it represents the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; by intelligence is represented the Son, because he is as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge begotten of his Father; by memory and by the will is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the Holy Ghost, because he is alone produced of the Father and the Son, these are distinct, yet one in essence, <hi>August: l:</hi> 15. <hi>de Trinitate cap:</hi> 20. <hi>Radu p:</hi> 2 <hi>controv:</hi> 13. <hi>Art:</hi> 2. this comparison I confesse as well as the former, is too short, for neither are the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the soul persons nor doth there appear in them such a strange and wonderfull manner of production, as in the glorious Persons of the blessed Trinity: this doth our faith with admiration apprehend which our knowledge cannot attain unto. To conclude, the premisses shew that this great mystery is not against reason,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:118911:23"/>though it be above reason, and it is an honourable imployment of them which have the most elevated intellectuals, to dis-intangle these high points of faith, from the absurdities which their cunning adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries would fasten on them, though they cannot display them in their full glory.</p>

I ask if it be never lawfull to pray, but only to God the Father through Jesus Christ? it is unanimously believed, and that from Scripture, that God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of religious invocation, you will not stick to grant that the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Person of the Holy Trinity, the Son of God, hath been, and is religiously invocated, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.59. 1. <hi>Thess:</hi> 3.11. <hi>The Lord Jesus Christ direct our way to you:</hi> and <hi>come Lord Jesus come quickly:</hi> and it was a Character to know a Christian by, that he called on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, is this prayer not according to the Rule of the Gospel? certainly by your loose kind of arguing, it would be all one as to say, O Son of God hear me for thy Sons sake: do you like of this Prayer as a savoury? and do you not renounce it rather as a senseless prayer? But we know that by religious invocation of the Son of God, his omnisciency, his omnipotency, and his love, and mercy are acknowledged, and he is much honoured by this religious service.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:118911:24"/>
               <p>Secondly, it is not absurd expresly to direct our prayers to the Holy Trinity, and this is implyed by the form in Baptism in part, baptizing Disciples into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and such a form of Prayer hath been in use in the Ancient Liturgy of S. <hi>Basil</hi> and S: <hi>Chrysostom,</hi> and in those of the Latine Church, whence it was derived into the Liturgy of the Church of <hi>England, O holy Trinity, one God, have mercy on us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is it absurd as Mr: <hi>Biddle</hi> inferreth, when we pray to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to the Trinity to conclude our Prayers, <hi>Grant these our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests for Christ his sake:</hi> for take notice that Christ may be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered by a relative opposition by two manner of ways: First, in regard of nature, which is a relation and opposition <hi>ad intra,</hi> as the School-men speak, as he relates to his Father, and the Holy Ghost in respect of his Person, as the Father loves the Son, the Son sends the Holy Ghost, &amp;c. Now in this consideration, we do not conclude our prayers, <hi>Hear us for Christ his sake.</hi> But secondly, Christ may be considered with a relation <hi>ad extra,</hi> according to the mystery of grace, he is our Mediator by divine institution, and by a voluntary condescention to satisfie divine justice for our salvation. Consider Christ, as simply a Mediator, and so he is an inferiour cause, in whose Name, and by whose mediation we have free accesse to God as the first cause, last end, and our chiefest good, and in this regard Christ may be a Mediator to himself without a third Person intervening, not as Christ is simply considered as the Son of God, but as he was the Son of God incarnated, and by his bloudy passion satisfied the wrath of God for us miserable sinners, and thus Jesus Christ in his own Person satisfied divine Justice, which was common to the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and thus as our Mediator brings us to himself as God. Thus elegantly saith <hi>Junius Defens. Trin.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I add what Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> may not contradict: That it is not necessary that we should in all our religious addresses to God expresly make mention of Christ, and conclude thus: <hi>Grant these our requests for Christ his sake;</hi> for there is an absolute prayer directed only to God, and vertually to the Trinity, without any mention of our Saviour, and this kind of Prayer is most frequent in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and common use: it was a good Prayer of the penitent Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican, <hi>Lord be mercifull to me a Sinner:</hi> a short prayer in words but sweet, and of large extent for matter, in the best prayer dictated by Christ himself, and that which is the Platform of all good prayers,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:118911:24"/>I mean in the Lords prayer there is no such inforcement to further the Prayer by Christ Jesus, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven:</hi> the word Father is attributed to God here not personally, but essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially; though all creatures are excluded by that title, yet all the three Persons are included, because they have one nature and will, are one and the same God, and all of them have a fatherly care of us; yea and many prayers of the Saints have been put up to God with such motives, that he would hear for his mercies sake, <hi>Psal.</hi> 44.26. for his own, for his truths, and names sake, though vertually I grant, the mediation of Christ our Saviour is not excluded.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, It is not denied, that our Prayers are most frequently directed to God the father, yet not excluding God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, who are co-eternal &amp; co-essential, and this worship is absolutely due to the Godhead, yet is the Father named, because we may more fitly conclude our Prayers according to that generall Rule of our Saviour, which we are carefully to walk by, to ask the Father in the name of Christ. <hi>Grant our Petitions for thy Sons sake Belar. l.</hi> 1. <hi>de Christi c.</hi> 17. I add, the Father is named, being the first principle of counsel, and first in order of reconciling man to God, but the Son of God hath the office of a Mediator, executing Gods pleasure by whom we go to the Father, and the Holy Ghost teacheth us what to pray, without whose assistance we cannot in a spirituall manner pour out our sighs and groans to God which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed, <hi>Rom:</hi> 8.26. The brightness of Gods glory hath spread it selfe throughout the World by the Ministery of his onely begotten Son, and in the manifold Graces of the Spirit, every way marvellous, and whatsoever is done to his glory, it is done in the power of the Holy Ghost,, and made acceptable to God by the merits and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation of Jesus Christ: to conclude, it sounds well in our ears to conclude our prayers, <hi>O blessed God grant our requests for thy Sons sake our Mediator and Advocate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Rule of praying to God in the name of Christ, is not generally true without limitation, and it doth demonstratively conclude that the Son of God is not the object of invocation, but that God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts our prayers when they are presented to God and persumed with the sweet odours of Christs merits, and yet Christ is religiously prayed unto, and this is so necessary, that your <hi>Cracovian</hi> Catechism saith, he is no Christian that doth not pray to him pag. 150:</p>
               <p>Christ, by this means should not only be the Son of the Father,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:118911:25"/>but of the Holy Ghost, yea of himself, I deny these loose consequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which are only asserted, but cannot be proved by our concessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and practice in prayer: he was indeed touching his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture conceived in the womb of the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> by the Holy Ghost. This will not serve your turn, but your drift is to prove, that the Son of God the Father is not true God, because of his act of Mediation for us to God the Father; this I say is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent, and mark the reason, because he performs not this office as he is simply the Son of God, but as he was God incarnated, it was his gratious and voluntary act to be our Mediator, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>supposed our Apostasie from God, whereas he was the Son of God before mans fall, so he was before the Creation of the World, even from all eternity; but how the Holy Ghost should (as you infer) be properly the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, because of his conception in the Virgins womb, which was in the latter times, is above, yea contrary to all sound reason and belief, for then of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity he should have communicated the essence of God to the Son by eternall generation, which was not done, and it is yet more senseless and ridiculous to say, that then he should be Son to himself, why so? because he performed an act of mediation to God in our Names, for this was not always done by him, yea, and Socinians will say, that God for many ages together was worshipped, when the Son had no subsistence, and consequently could have no actings for us, but Christ was the Son of God before the beginning of time, and he is not our Mediator simply as Gods Son, but as God-man, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing we deny not, but do confesse, that all the three sacred Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons did joyntly concur in that outward Work, the production of the humane nature, which was hypostatically united to the second Person, though by that kind of speech which is called appropriation, it is ascribed to the Holy Ghost.</p>

               <p>First, I say this is, if my memory fails me not, a false charge, for I remember not that any of your Adversaries will say the word [God] is appropriated to the first Person, it is dangerous to invent phrases which are not allowed by common use, it is not denied that all the actions of the Trinity (those only excepted which are of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinsecall relation, as the Father to beget his Son) are the joynt and undivided Works of the Trinity, because there is but one divine
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:118911:27"/>and infinite essence, yet the blessed God in Scripture condescending to our weak capacities, not able to conceive distinctly the Trinity of the Persons in the unity of the God-head, but by a distinction of their operations to us ward, attributes the great work of Creation to the Father, Redemption to the Son, and sanctification to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, not by way of negation, but distinction, by a phrase which is commonly called appropriation, <hi>Halons: l.</hi> 2. <hi>qu:</hi> 6. <hi>de Creatione A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin:</hi> 1. <hi>par. q.</hi> 39. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. yet do not ours I suppose say, that the Name of God is appropriated to the Father which is frequently ascribed to the Son, and sometimes to the Holy Ghost, as I have proved: I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny not the name God is often attributed, I do not say appropriated to God the Father.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Besides your explication, of appropriated, saying it is foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on some excellency and prerogative above the rest of the same sort may be called into question, and warrantably denied, as sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is appropriated to the Holy Ghost, not for any excellency and prerogative of operation above the Father and Son, which do in as eminent and excellent a manner sanctifie, as the Holy Ghost, nor doth the title Lord applyed to our Saviour belong to him in a more excellent manner then to the Father, though for some speciall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations sanctification is the work of the third Person: and Lord belongs to Christ, for nothing whereof the Father is Author can be done in a more excellent manner then by the Father.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, if the Authors words be not taken in a short but a large sense. The very ground which he builds on may be denied, for albeit one Person is not before another in time, nor in honour, and albeit the Father as he is God simply hath no preheminence in regard of the divine nature, which is wholly and most singularly one, and in which regard these three Persons are one God, yet if the first be considered personally, being distinct from the Son, and the Holy Ghost, as he is in order before them, and as he is the principle of their Persons, I will not stick to grant, if that be the thing you plead for, that some preheminence belongs to the Father, whence he is frequently called God, and this is commonly acknowledged by our best Authors.</p>

               <p>A word simply common to three, may in some places of Gods Word without any inconvenience in another respect be ascribed to one Person of the holy Trinity; thus for instance, Lord Saviour usu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally meant of Gods Son in the new Testament, yet are applied to God the Father, and Father is spoken often of the first Person, yet sometimes is taken essentially, and meant of the Son, who i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Here your Rule takes place, by way of eminency: the like doe I affirme, that the word [God] is frequently ascribed to the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ being first in order of subsisting, and of working, the circumstances of the places where God is alledged, do clear it, that it is to be taken relatively; if not, God is taken essentially, for God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost: nor doth it trouble us at all, that we have no example in all the Creation fully to illustrate these high my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, which are far above our reach and reason, left to it self with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out divine illumination; for such an excellency of God the Father above the Son and Holy Ghost as belongs to the Creatures, when they are for eminency singled out of the rest of the same kind, as to say the Philosopher (meaning <hi>Aristotle,</hi>) the Poet, <hi>viz.

                  <p>This <hi>Socinian</hi> seems to be very zealous for the honour of God the Father, and therefore he doth denie the Deity of the Son of God, and of the Holy Ghost, that God the Father might have the highest honour, whereas in truth this Argument may be inverted, and not the true God but an Idol is acknowledged in his place, if one should seign a man to be destitute of a reasonable soul, none can say the worship of this liveless fiction is an honour done to a true man. <hi>Socinians,</hi> because they rob the Son of his Deity, and do not worship the Trinity in unity, they devise a worship of God not warranted by the word of God, &amp; so tis rejected, as a fiction of their own brains: and this position will be made good, by deniall of the Trinity, the glory of the true God is prohibited. The holy word teacheth us <hi>Philip:</hi> 2.11. that to confesse that Jesus Christ is Lord doth exceedingly redound to the honour of the Father in that he is
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:118911:28"/>the first personall principle subsisting of himselfe and by himselfe, and gives subsistence to two glorious Persons which are equal to himself, nor doth the Father receive that honor, which is contumelous to his Son, <hi>John</hi> 5.23. when any one to the dishonour of the Son of God shal pretend to honor the Father, he doth really offend both the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, saith <hi>Austen Ser.</hi> 56. <hi>de verbis Domini.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereas in your amplification you say that the highest love and honour is due to the Father, being the most high, &amp; all other things are to be loved for him, and if all other things, then the Son of God, &amp; the Holy Ghost, I answer, your antecedent is granted, but I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny your consequence. The highest love is due to God the Father, who denies it? but from thence to infer as you do, that the highest honor is not due to God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, is inconsequent. All creatures, I grant, are excluded thereby, even the humane nature of our blessed Saviour shares not in that highest degree of love and honour, which is a peculiar prerogative due to God, but we may not exclude the second and third Person of the Trinity, who are co-essentiall co-eternall and equally to be honoured with the first Person of the sacred Trinity; and to make this good we shall in due place, prove, that the title most high belongs not only to the Father, but the Son of God he is most high, and the Holy Ghost is most high.</p>

                  <p>Touching the substance of this Section, 'tis already answered, the Adversary incurs a double reprehension in these few lines.</p>
                  <p>First in using the word [beholding] in speaking of these divine mysteries, which is improper, dangerous, if not scandalous, and not used in this sense in the Scriptures, nor I think in Classicall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors: most certain it is, that all creatures are beholding to God for their being, and for all the good they have which springs from the Fountaine of goodness it selfe, yet it was not a naturall, but
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:118911:29"/>an arbitrary act of God in time to create and to preserve them, 'tis otherwise in these deep mysteries, the Father is an intrinsecall prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of his Sons subsistence communicating the divine nature to him by eternall generation, and that not in a way of freedome, as if it might be done, or not be done, but necessarily and in the unity of the self same single and indivisible nature, and upon this account the relation of the Father to the Son is a necessary relation, which never did begin, nor shall ever cease to be, if it were a possibility for the bright Sun to have been created from eternity, the light which breaks forth from it by a naturall evacuation would have been eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall, and if I may have leave so to speak, contemporary with the Sun. Gods Son is called <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> similitude this is which holds forth that which to carnall reason might seem incredible, <hi>viz.</hi> the coeternity of the Son in his glory with the Father, the like is to be said concerning the personall act of breathing forth the blessed Spirit, it was not properly a voluntary act <hi>per modum voluntatis,</hi> but a necessary and a natural act <hi>sine potentia ad oppositum,</hi> as the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men speak: now then sithence it is most certain that the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature is not multiplied in the Person, but is one and the same in them, and the three holy Persons are co equall and co-eternall because they are co-essentiall, they have all one essence, mind, will, power, and Godhead, therefore the highest love and honour is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually due to God the Father, to God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, and the denial hereof by Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> is high blasphemy, which his corrupt reason and wanton wit prompts him to, whereas divine faith relying on the prime veritie admires and adores it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The second thing which I justly do take exception to, is your inference, if equall honour be due to God the Father and the other sacred Persons, then they would have a preheminence above him, who is the most high God: mark his wild inference, which is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as truly his own, but not owned by his Adversaries. Verily there is a tacite contradiction in these words, to have a prehemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence in honour, and yet to be equall in honour; we plead for equality of honour to all the sacred Persons, and are not so far desti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of understanding, as to give the preheminence of love and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Son of God, or Holy Ghost above God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>

                  <head>Answ.</head>
                  <p>Blessed be our God (say I also) for the many testimonies and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of the Deity of the Son of God, which are as glittering pearls in the sacred Scriptures, and for those which this fifth Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>John</hi> cited by you do hold forth unto us.</p>
                  <p>First, because Christ calls God his Father, now by the law of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, an eternall Father must needs relate to an eternall Son, and to denie the God head of the Son, is to denie the Fathers also, for the nature of this Argument, is, that both terms <hi>relatum</hi> and <hi>correla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> should be together, and consequently he that denies the Son to be true God, hath no God at all for his God, v: 17.</p>
                  <p>Secondly because the Son of God doth the same works, and after the same manner the Father doth them, <hi>vers.</hi> 17.19.20.22. and therefore is equall with his Father.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because he hath by eternall generation the life of God given to him, and not simply given, but after the same manner as it is in himself, for as the Father hath life in himself, <hi>vers:</hi> 25.26. <hi>viz.</hi> eternally and independently, so hath the Son the same life eternally and independently.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Because the power of Christ is omnipotent, for by it all the dead shall be raised up to life at the last day, <hi>John</hi> 5.28.29. who, I pray you can do this great work but God?</p>
                  <p>To your descanting on the Text, saying, the Son is not to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured as much as the Father, but as the Father.</p>
                  <p>To this first I say, that this Scripture affirmeth not that a less ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is to be exhibited to the Son then to the Father. Thus far then you have no advantage.</p>
                  <pb n="33" facs="tcp:118911:30"/>
                  <p>Secondly I answer, the particle [as] is not always <hi>diminuens ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> so as it should diminish the honour due to the only begotten Son of God, in comparison of the honour due to the Father, but it may be taken declarative, demonstrative, and <hi>identicè</hi> to declare to us, that he is to be honoured with the same honour the Father is honoured withall, in <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>c. v.</hi> 14. we read, we beheld his glory, as the only begotten of his Father, which particle is omitted <hi>vers:</hi> 18. where he is simply called the only begotten Son of God. To return to the 14. <hi>vers.</hi> where it is said <hi>we saw his glory as the only begotten of his Father:</hi> 'tis like to that speech when we see a King sitting on his Throne in his royall robes, with a Crown on his head and a Scepter in his hand, we should say, now we see him as a King, now he is like himself, his state is agreeable to his Maj<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>sty: even so were the glimpses of Christs glory, which the Apostles at times beheld agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Majesty of the only begotten Son of God. Our learned <hi>Junius</hi> hath observed this particle [as] is taken three ways in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> for <hi>the same,</hi> for <hi>equall,</hi> and <hi>the like</hi> in similitude. Thus the foot adheres to the body of Man as doth the hand, I put not any great stress in this if logically examined, a fitter example is 1. <hi>John</hi> 14. tis meant of parity, as when I say <hi>Paul</hi> is as <hi>Peter</hi> in the Apostleship; and lastly and most usually it denotes similitude, <hi>be ye holy as your Father in heaven is holy: Be ye perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect, Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>forgive us our Trespasses as we forgive them that tres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe against us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer then, Gods giving and Christs receiving argue not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstratively inequality of honour to be exhibited to the Son, and lesse then that which is due to the Father, for as Christ receiveth honour from the Father, so doth he give honour to the Father, <hi>John</hi> 8.50. So that this giving and receiving is mutuall, the Son seeks the Fathers glory, and the Father seeks the Sons glory, the words of S. <hi>John</hi> are not absolutely to be taken, but <hi>secundum quid,</hi> as is evident by the foreging words in the same verse, <hi>the Father judgeth none, viz.</hi> alone without his Son, as the Jews imagined, but hath given all judgement to the Son incarnated; he hath given it to his Son, but he hath not deprived himselfe of it, he governs all things now by his Son, and will judge all, men, and Dev ls by his Son; the Father will raise the dead and the Son will ra se them, <hi>tota indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua Trinitas secundum authoritatem judicat,</hi> as the Sun inlightens the world by its refreshing beams, and neither doth the Sun without
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:118911:30"/>his beams, nor the beams without the Sun produce this desired ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the aire, our Saviour shall be the Judge according to both natures, each nature acting according to its innate principles: to know all secrets belongs to the Deity, but to pronounce the finall sentence is an act of the humanity, that as all men do honour the Father, so should they honour the Son also, and adore his Divinity reigning by his humanity, with one and the self same religious ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration wherewith the Father is adored; the materiall object of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour is Christ our Mediator who is both God and Man, but the formal, proper and adequate ground or reason hereof is the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature and infinite excellency of our blessed Saviour, and it is not founded upon any temporary office, service, or benefit nor any externall denomination and relation.</p>
                  <p>The other Text cited out of the first Epistle of <hi>John,</hi> cap: 5. v. 2. doth not formally and in terms hold forth any comparison of higher love to one then to another, but positively sets down this generall rule he that loves him that is begotten, loves him that doth beget. This then is impertinently alledged. Secondly, if the holy word had intimated or required greater love to him that begets, then to him that is begotten, yet would not your position have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by this Scripture, for I do yield according to the genuine sense of this Text, which is much mistaken by the Adversary, that the Father begetting is a great deal more lov'd &amp; ought to be more lov'd then the Son that is begotten, for it speaks not of our loving Christ the natural Son of God, but of Christians the adopted Sons of God spiritually begotten, &amp; the holy Text speaks in the singular number of one, because there is the same reason of loving one Christian as all: this is the meaning, if we love God, we will love his Children. The whole context holds forth this Exposition.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, either honor and love is due to the Holy Ghost by the warrant of Gods word or not; if not, how can you truly say, <hi>without question much love and honor is due to his Person?</hi> is not the Word of God acknowledged by you an all-sufficient Rule to direct us what persons are to be worshipped, what are not capable of divine honor? and do not you tacitely intimate in these words, saying, <hi>that love and honor is not expresly injoyned in the Scriptures to his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son?</hi> if such religious offices are, though not expresly, and in so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny terms, yet if it be founded on the word, and derived from those sacred fountains by necessary consequence this may suffice to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us touching the lawfulness to adore him, <hi>the holy Angels confirmed in grace worshipped him, Esay</hi> 6.3.9. compared with <hi>Acts</hi> 28.26. the Church militant is exhorted to worship him as the great God, and our Maker, <hi>Psa.</hi> 95.6.7. compared with <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.8.9. and are not our bodies Temples of the Holy Ghost? and therefore he must be honored and glorified with our souls and bodies; if spiritual sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces be not offred to him, the Temple will be polluted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.16. 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 19.

                  <p>It is a true assertion, which we do with all reverence and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse subscribe unto, that not only touching this particular now under debate, but concerning all matters of faith and worship we must neither adde nor take away from the word of God, but faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully observe it, as an unerring Rule of doctrines and worship: let us see whether it doth countenance your opinion.</p>

                  <p>The second place is largely explained in my pneumatology, p: 54. the sum is, <hi>the Holy Ghost receives all by eternall procession:</hi> nor is it expresly said in this Text, <hi>the Holy Ghost receive all of me,</hi> but <hi>mine,</hi> viz. <hi>what is prophesied of me by the Holy Prophets,</hi> and that is when he gives a cleer testimony by the powerfull preaching of the Gospel, that Christ is our Saviour, and where he brings the doctrine home to the hearts of Heaven by effectuall vocation; thus doth the Holy Ghost glorifie Christ, both by washing away sins by the bloud of Christ, and mortifying sins by vertue of the death of Christ: the Holy Ghost receives all, not as a Schollar from Christ his Master, not by learning any new thing unknown to him before; to be sure it is a miserably perverting that text to say the Holy Ghost was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the mysteries of the Gospel til he was informed of them by the Son of man, and that must be above four thousand years after the Creation; for how was it possible that he which knoweth the things of God, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.11. and inspired the Prophets to foretell the particulars which in time befell him according to their predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions should be ignorant of them? this your bold assertion is a blaspemous dotage, and it is divised without any colour of reason or Scripture rightly interpreted, to support it.</p>

                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:118911:32"/>and by consequence he is inferior to Christ, this term is no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture term, as applied to the Holy Ghost, nor can he by the Rules of Metaphysicks be said to depend on, for that is not said to be depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on another, which hath his being from another, but that which is in propriety of speech an effect from another as the cause thereof, and which hath an essence distinct in number from him that commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates it, so that there is no dependency of Gods Son on his Father, though there is relation betwixt them; nor doth the Holy Ghost depend on the Father and Son of God, the reason is, because the essence is not myltiplied, but one and the same in them all, depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency is, I grant, an Argument of inferiority, it is an inferior which doth depend on the superior, thus do all the Creatures depend on God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, and that as <hi>Suarez</hi> hath well observed in a fourfold consideration. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause every finite thing hath received its being from God who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, they are all in him and the workman-ship of his hands. 2. As they do depend upon God for their production, so are they also upheld by him by an act of divine conversation, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are subject to him in order to their annihillation, if he shall only suspend his divine conserving influx, they instantly return to nothing. 3. All creatures do depend upon him in regard of their naturall or voluntary operations, our vitall act ons and motions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on the gratious or free concurrence of God, which inables them to act according to those very principles of actions &amp; motions which are in them distinct from that concourse by which their lives and principles of actions are in every kind preserved, in so much, he we never so well appointed or prepared for action, in respect of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated principles sufficiently disposed thereunto, yet without a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular influence or concurrence from God, which is necessary to support and excite the principle in its actions, there is none of them can act, or support its action. All creatures in my supposition are like the wheels of a Water-Mill, they cannot move without a fresh sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of streams of water, or like the Sails of Wind-Mills, which stir not at all without blasts of wind. 4. All Creatures depend upon God, and are in a potentiality to receive and do whatsoever God will have them, as he can make an Asse to speak, &amp; he can turn stones into bread. The Adversary can never prove that the Holy Ghost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the Father and Son of God in any of these ways, which do properly belong to the creature, which is in all respects finite, and not to the infinite Creator.</p>

                  <p>This Reason against the Trinity may be thus framed: God is the first cause of all things.</p>
                  <p>The Son and the Holy Ghost are not the first cause of all things, therefore the Son and the Holy Ghost are not God.</p>
                  <p>The major is proved by a common notion in all men, and by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36.</p>
                  <p>The minor is proved, because the Son and Holy Ghost are caused by the Father.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer punctually by a concession of the Major: it is very true which the Adversary saith, and unanimously acknowledged
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:118911:34"/>by us, that God is the first cause of all things, but take God in the sense intended by him, then it is erroneous and impious, for power which produceth all things is not a notionall attribute of the first Person, if we will speak properly, but an essentiall attribute of God, who is in essence most simple, and singularly one in the three glorious Persons: it is not doubted by us, that God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, are the prime cause both of Creation, and all other things. But now this enemy to the sacred Trinity, opposeth God not to the Creatures, but to the Son and Holy Ghost, and in this sense the major proposition is most false, so that this Argument is grounded upon a false supposition, as though the acknowledgement of three blessed Persons in the sacred Trinity, did overthrow this common notion, which is imprinted on our souls by God himself God is the same with the first cause which was never denied by the Orthodox, and must we then take your bare word as a sufficient proof, without any convincing proofs at all, that by God the first Person is meant? The divine Nature and the divine Persons cannot be seperated; the Scripture doth not present any such abstract notion to us of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but they are described as divine Persons, which have the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature, and not as the Adversaries say, behold a Trinity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God, we then do look upon every Person as God, and do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge all the three Persons to be one and the same God.</p>
                  <p>The Text of Scripture which you alledge, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. furthers not your cause, but it doth sufficiently confirm my former dist<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that God is taken essentially both by the whole context and by the words themselves: whatsoever man hath, he hath it all from God as the procreant cause, and by him, as the cause conserving, supporting and upholding all things, and for him, as the utmost end, for his glory; without the inscription of glory to God no work is coyn to be put into his Treasury, and therefore God is debtor to none, but all are beholding to him for whatsoever they are, and whatsoever they have. How this Text should serve your turn, I shall never see, till you shall prove, which is impossible to be done, that Creation and preservation are not the undivided operation of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>The Adversary doth often, and much magnifie Reason and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding touching this subject, I say, that Reason and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:118911:35"/>in men are as different as their fancies or faces, nor is it constant, one and the same to the same man at divers times: 'tis a blind Guide now to us being fallen from God, a deceitfull Rule, not able to shew us the way to heaven: we converse here in a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Aegypt, which is our naturall state; no advancing towards, or getting into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but by a Pillar of fire supernaturally raised, and divinely moved to conduct us thither; these great mysteries are a business of more worth and weight, then to be admitted or rejected according to our understanding, whence it is that the Scripture doth frequently cry down the wisdom of the World, the judgement of the naturall man, the vain deceits of Heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophers (who were the great Masters and admirers of Reason) and the darkness of our understanding in things divine, and in the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>I am now to speak of the proof of your assumption, that the Son and Holy Ghost are caused of the Father, and therefore they cannot be the first cause: I will not deny that there are some eminent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, which make no scruple to say the Father is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>the cause,</hi> and the Son is <hi>the effect</hi> of his Father, which are not to be construed, as though they took the word <hi>cause</hi> in a proper notion, but in a large sense reducing him analogically to that Topick, yet wil not this concession be any advantage at all for Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> for the same Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors which call the Father the <hi>cause</hi> of the Son, because the Father communicates the divine essence to him, are resolved that God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost are the first cause of all things.</p>
                  <p>I conceive the answer is more safe, if we will speak properly, as it is fit we should in disputations, to deny that the Father is the cause of the Son, that albeit he receives all from the Father (as the Holy Ghost doth the divine essence, and essentiall properties from them both) yet is not the Father to speak in rigor an efficient cause of the Son of God, nor ought we, nor can we truly so call him; for that is truly and properly a cause which hath a causall influx, so as the effect must depend upon the cause, according to the nature thereof, as it is <hi>in fieri,</hi> or <hi>in facto esse.</hi> the Son, I grant, receives all essentials from the Father, but not as from an externall cause, but rather as from an internall principle, then a cause; he is the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of his Son: a principle is of larger event then a cause; every cause is a principle, but every principle is not a cause, but when it
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:118911:35"/>is restrained to a causall principle which then is verified, when that which is from the principle depends upon it, which dependency, as I have shewed aboue, hath no place in the sacred Trinity, and as the name cause requires that the effect should depend on it, so doth it further impart, as usually it is taken, a diversity of substance or being betwixt the cause and the effect, and consequently a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt them in some degree of perfection; he that is a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Son depends upon his Father, and receives an individuall nature distinct from that which the Father hath, and is actually seperated from him: it is far otherwise in the diuine generation, the same nature which is simply independent is communicated by the Father to the Son not in time, but before time was; not voluntarily, but natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally and necessarily, and consequently the relation betwixt the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son is mutuall, without any dependency of the Son on his Father: there is, I grant, an order betwixt the Father begetting and the Son begotten; the Father, though he be not the cause, yet he is, as some learned speak, <hi>quasi causa,</hi> and this order is without priority, or posteriority, because the essence is one and the same in both the Relatives, and as Relatives must needs be <hi>simul natura.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I answer in a word to the Argument proposed to us, and do say, that the Father as he is God, and not as a distinct person only, is the only cause of causes, the prime and chiefest cause of all things, and consequently the Son of God the Father, and the Holy Ghost as one God, are the first and highest cause of all things.

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:118911:36"/>easie way of believing in God set down in Scriptures, hunting after ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scurities, have by the cunning of Satan lost themselves in the endless Mazes of error and superstition.</hi>

                  <p>To this weak argument I answer,</p>
                  <p>First, be it a while supposed, which yet must not be granted, that neither the Patriarchs nor the Prophets had an explicite and distinct knowledge of this high mystery, and that the besotted Jews not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the authenticallness of the new Testament, do at this day, as in former ages believe as their ancient Fore-fathers did, and will not believe this mystery, which Christians now do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently avouch and humbly adore, as clearly revealed to them, for we may take notice how God in naturall things observes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and that they do not at once arrive at ripeness and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. There is in Trees a <hi>blossome,</hi> and a <hi>bud,</hi> before the <hi>fruit,</hi> and a child begins first to learn his Letters, then to read, before he can attain exact knowledge: thus doth God make himself known by degrees; yet to be sure what at any time to his servants was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, was sufficient for their salvation: for he being a wise and a gracious God, will require no more of them, then what is given to them. Thus God revealed himself to the later Prophets more fully in many particulars touching our Saviour then he did to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> had more glimmering light of him then <hi>Adam</hi> had. God by <hi>Moses</hi> instituted Sacrifices, and abundance of significant Ceremonies which were never discovered to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and God instituted Circumcision in <hi>Abrahams</hi> dayes, which was a rite divine unknown to <hi>Noah,</hi> and all his Progenitors. Can it then seem to be a strange thing that God reserved some mystery to reveal by his Son in our flesh, which was not known by the Prophets? and what greater then the Trinity, which neither men nor Angels can comprehend; and both men and Angels must for ever adore. Nor do I think that all truths are yet revealed, but we shall have a further knowledge of God in the state of glory then now we have, and this stands well with the honour and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty of God, that as there was a Court-yard, a Temple, before we could enter into the holiest of holies, so should we also have our knowledge of God by degrees.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I may not so far wrong the Patriarchs, <hi>Moses</hi> and the Prophets, as to think they were utterly ignorant of this sacred
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:118911:36"/>mystery, though probably they had not such an express knowledge hereof as was by the good hand of God revealed in the Gospel, not in such clear manner and in such convincing terms, but in part invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in types and figures, and as those famous ones, so might the meaner Jewes believe in the Trinity, but you Doctor-like have laid down their abhorrency of the sacred Trinity, which you should have soundly proved, and not barely asserted: your confident words are to us no authenticall proofs; some of the Rabbins con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with Christians in the belief of the Holy Trinity, which are used by noble <hi>Mornaeus</hi> in his learned Book <hi>de Veritate Christianae religionis pag:</hi> 72. and the Hebrew Doctors have left Records of this sacred mystery, though at this day that Nation understands it not, saith <hi>Ainsworth</hi> on 1. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. to name no more Authors; See the mystery of the word <hi>Aelohim,</hi> there are three degrees, and every degree by it selfe alone (that is, distinct) and yet notwithstanding, they all are one, and joyned together in one and are not divided one from another, saith <hi>Rab. Simeon Ben Jochoi in Zoar.</hi> on the 6. Section of <hi>Leviticus,</hi> and if the later Jewes do not believe this they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated in this particalar from the faith of Gods holy servants; for <hi>Abraham</hi> saw Christ, and as touching his Person he was before <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> for he saith, <hi>before Abraham was, I am, Joh.</hi> 8. though not in our own assumed nature, and this was the faith of the holy ones: what means that so frequently inculcated <hi>Jehovah, Elohim.

It is an assertion of learned <hi>Gerrard lib: de Mysterio Trin. That the doctrine of the Trinity is necessary to be believed of all those that look to be saved, and that not only the negation, but the ignorance thereof is damnable:</hi> his reason is, <hi>because he that knoweth not God as he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed himself in his word, doth err from the true God, and makes an Idol of a glorious God; nor can one Person of the sacred Trinity be known and worshipped without the knowledge of another, Joh.</hi> 14.1. &amp; 15.23. and this knowledge (saith mine Author) was necessary also in the Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, albeit in these days the new Testament is like the Sun, and the old like the Moon which borroweth her light of the Sun. Of the new Testament, as <hi>Luther</hi> would often say, I dare not, I confess, pass such a
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:118911:37"/>harsh sentence on all that depart this life without the explicite knowledge of this mystery this is to cover their graves with a stone of despair, on whose souls the Lord perhaps hath shewed mercy. All such do erre, I grant, which are ignorant of the Trinity: but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be an error to death which infallibly damns, <hi>judicent peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiores.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I adde that you do falaciously argue, alledging <hi>non cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sam pro causa:</hi> it was not the great majesty of Christ, as he was God, which was a scandall to the Jewes, for this they apprehended not, nor did they believe it, though they might have learned it, both by the Doctrine and miracles of our Saviour, for then they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory: they startled not simply at this, that the Son of God, and promised <hi>Messias</hi> should be equall to his Father. <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> the Law and the Prophets did attend Christ when he was transfigured in the Mount, <hi>Matth:</hi> 17. inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating thereby, that they had Christ in dark resemblances, and that he must needs be the naturall, and not the adopted Son of God, the Jews knew the Son of God must be of the very divine Nature, <hi>John</hi> 5.18. (as a Son is of the same nature with the Father) but they interpreted this to be blasphemy in Christ, whom they believed not to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> which presupposeth the great mystery of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; this offended them that Jesus should take upon him to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> that he whose Parents they knew, and saw to live in a mean condition, yea, and not long after to be put to an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious death, this, as, not I, but the Apostle sheweth was a <hi>stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block to the Jews,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. the ground of their mistake was a deluded apprehension, that their <hi>Messias</hi> should be a glorious King in this world, and restore again the Kingdom of <hi>Israel,</hi> and set the captivated Jews into a free and happy condition, but missing of their expectation and worldly felicity, they wickedly rejected him, as the Papists this day do erre concerning Antichrist, because they do erroneously describe that man of sin, with the characters of such an ugly Monster, as never was, or should be found in any man, and do not know their state to be Antichristian, nor the Roman Pope to be the head of that fore-told Apostasie, though he lives vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly amongst them, yet as the Doctrines and practises approved by the Church, do prove the Pope to be the very man which was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> and S. <hi>John,</hi> albeit the Papists are ignorant of it, and do not better esteem of the Publishers here of then to be blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers:
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:118911:37"/>so also did the gratious doctrine and powerfull works of the <hi>Messias,</hi> demonstrate him to be in truth, though many of the Jewes which conversed with him did not believe that he was the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Israel,</hi> but those that are enlightned Christians will confess, as <hi>Nazianzene</hi> some where saith, <hi>They cannot see one God, but they must see the glory of the three Persons; nor can they with the eyes of their souls see the three Persons, but they will see and acknowledge the one infinite essence and Majesty of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I will reason <hi>ad hominem,</hi> and demand of you Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> whether is your Faith, touching the <hi>Messias,</hi> pleasing to the Jews or not? I suppose you have not the face to avouch the former, for albeit you hold him to be a meer Creature, and not the true God, and do wretchedly deny this satisfaction made to the divine justice for the sins of the world, yet you cannot, you dare not deny that he is a Saviour and no impostor, in regard of his Crosse, which was the Jews scandall, but Christians glory. Now if you will charge us with a fault in that our doctrine is displeasing to the Jewes, are you to be commended for doing the like in reference to the offence of Jews? or if you have such a longing desire to gain them, or at least to be one with the Jewes, why do you not Judaize and absolute re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a crucified Saviour? why do you not with a Schoolmaster which became a Jew, and wrote from <hi>Thessalonica,</hi> that the reason why he revolted from Christianity, was because he could not digest the mystery of the Trinity, as Dr. <hi>Cheynel</hi> relates.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, I Answer, the great mysteries of our Salvation must not be renounced to gratifie blind and sinfull men, their scandall is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by themselvs, not given by us, if they wilbe offended at heavenly truths, we must let them alone: they must, if they love their salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, come to us: we must not, if we will be saved, go to them, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> it's absurd and unreasonable to call on Christ, or to be called a Christian, and to judaize, for Christianity believes not in Judaism, but Judaism in Christianity, <hi>Ignat. Epist. ad Magnesios.</hi> besides to our comfort and the confirmation of our faith in Christ, their scandall and rejection of their <hi>Messias,</hi> and their blinding and being forsaken of God is foretold, <hi>Esa.</hi> 8.14.15.16. and <hi>Esa.</hi> 6.9.11. and 65.12.66.4. <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.26. Christ is called <hi>a stone of offence:</hi> and they thought they did God good service in putting him to death, but albeit they haled and martyred the Apostles, yet are they never called the stone of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:118911:38"/>offence, and 21. <hi>v. Esay</hi> 8. it is foretold, <hi>that they should curse their King and their God:</hi> what God? not an Idol, then would they have said their Idol, but never is the Lord when he is called <hi>The God of Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> said to be an Idol; besides, these words are not words of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting sinners, for the Law forbids subjects to curse their King, but of impious fretting persons, as the context shews: by the name <hi>God</hi> then is meant the Father or the Son, not the Father, the Jewes never cursed God the Father to this day, but most fearfully have, and do curse God the Son, and this is further proved by the name King, for what King after this Prophesie did the Jews curse, but Christ who was both the King and God of the Jews? and unless one and the same person had been understood by King and God, the name King, as is the Scriptures use, should have been set after God. They cursed God and their King, and as they delighted in cursing, so Gods curse, according to their fearfull imprecation, hath most justly, visibly, and heavily fallen on them, and lies upon them to this day for shedding of the bloud of the Lord of life: I do truly and cordially compassionate them, because they were once Gods people, of whom Christ came in the flesh, and their fault was, they did set up their rest, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Moses,</hi> where God intended only a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and as it is our duty, I do heartily pray for their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, not doubting but the time will come when they shall look by faith on the Son of God, whom they have crucified, and with godly sorrow mourn for their sins, as for the loss of an only Son, and be one in faith on the Son of God, with the Apostles and primitive Christians, and shall become, according to the Prophesies, a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Church.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly and lastly, the doctrine of the Trinity is the genuine do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Christian Religion it self, and the very same in later daies held forth to the Church, was published both by our blessed Saviours own blessed mouth, and his holy Apostles and others, and the generality of the Jews had then their eyes blinded and hearts hardened, as well as their unhappy posterity; can you shew that the Jews then did not renounce Christ upon the same motives, that the accursed Jews have done in later ages? if their hatred of Idolatry now makes them to detest Christianity, I mean in reference to the doctrine of the Trinity, Did not the same ground prevail with them not to submit to Christ, which lived in the happy dayes of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Disciples? It is true they have abhorred many ages
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:118911:38"/>outward Idolatry and the worship of a false God, but they are deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly defiled with inward Idolatry, in that they worship not God after his revealed will, that is, Trinity in unity: and I may truly say, the doctrine and practise of the Socinians themselves, is flat Idolatry in the judgement of the deluded Jews, for they do invocate and give religious worship to Christ, and stick not to call him God, and by this means you do put an excuse into the mouths of the incredulous Jews, why they should not believe in Christ, for they were taught by God himself, <hi>The gods that made not the Heavens and Earth shall be destroyed:</hi> this is an indefinite proposition and true at all times, was written by the Prophet in the Chaldee tongue, which they were to learn by heart as it were,
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.11</note> and always to remember to prevent Idolatry, the Jews then may thus reply. <hi>Lord, thou wouldst have this golden sentence deeply imprinted in our memories, that we should nor receive or worship any God that made not Heaven and Earth; he not, we beseech thee, angry with us, who being admonished by thy divine Oracle, shall renounce him from being God which hath not made the Heavens and the Earth? thou Lord hast forbidden that we should have any other to be God before thy face: this is the first, and the great Commandement, we cannot obey this Commandement if we take him to be God, which is a God diverse from thee, if he be a God: thou Lord hast often inculcated this truth, there is no other God and Saviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides thee; how then can we acknowledge another God and Saviour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides thee, and exalt his name with divine honors?</hi> I see not how the <hi>Socinians</hi> can stop the mouths of the Jews, unless they come to us and acknowledge Christ to be God which made Heaven and Earth.</p>

                  <p>First I do observe your itching humor to be adding of your own, to make that which is pious in it self, but in the Adversiries judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be very odious, if possible to be more odous. You are b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:118911:39"/>eternal Processions, Incarnations, Hypostatical unions for who, I pray you speaketh in those terms, or can truly so speak? none, but enemies to the Truth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I grant that strange words invented out of vanity and curiosity by the boldness of a private spirit, are to be rejected but not such words which have been approved, &amp; long used in the Catholick Church, and which warrantable and just necessity hath brought into the world; <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>First this your argument drawn into the field against us is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by your own practise, for if no words are to be used, but such as are the pure language of Scripture, how durst you so fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently as you have done throughout your book use the word <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity?</hi> Do you find it once mentioned in all those sacred volumes? you must then either have a larger priviledge then the Church of Christ, which is unreasonable once to think, or else your accusation in the ground thereof comes to nothing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is no fault to use words to make divine Truths plain and easie, provided, that the new words are not invented to cloath a corrupt doctrine, but the clearing up of the truth, not to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw any from the true sense of the holy Word, but to make it more easie to be understood, who can justly find fault with the word <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> as it is applied to Baptism, and the Supper of the Lord? and if any shall object against this, and other like words, where is that word or the former objected in Scripture, so used? I will return the same answer as <hi>Luther</hi> did to <hi>Carolestadius lib.</hi> 2. <hi>And why dost thou forbid them to be called Sacraments, which Christ hath not forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in his word?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I may truly say of these new words as learned <hi>Vossius</hi> did of explicated Creeds: <hi>Non licuit per haereticos</hi>— The Hereticks would not suffer the Church to continue in the primitive simplicity of the faith of words, <hi>de tribus Symbolis dissertat.</hi> 1. <hi>Num.</hi> 25. new words were devised to oppose new Heresies; novelty is from Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, they do strive and contend for it, truth is on our side, and we do with new language at once both confirm it, and confound the Adversaries to it; if Enemies shall devise new inventions to do mischief, may not Gods Servants have new devised words to prevent their intended purposes? to deny this help is all one, as <hi>Hilary</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered

                  <p>Here is a great deale of empty wind, but no Corn is shaken off: I note first, your vain humour to be carping and cavilling at our Translation, and needlesly to pick a quarrel against it, for if the Order of the Hebrew words is exactly to be observed, they run thus: <hi>there shall be Lord one;</hi> why then do you vary from it? the truth is, the objection is not materiall, for the sense is one and the same in your and our reading the words.</p>
                  <p>To the objected place applied to the Covenanters I do avouch that you do slander them, and your false accusation is raised from a false interpretation of the whole Text.</p>
                  <p>First, who are better Judges of their own words then themselves who composed and approved it? are they not all of them (except perhaps some few Sectaries) unanimous that there are not three
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:118911:40"/>Lords, but one Lord? and are they not fully perswaded without wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering, as in charity I am bound to judge, that there are not three Gods, but one only God? What a forehead then have you, that shame doth not cover your face for an imputation of their breach of Covenant, when you have their protestation to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary?</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I answer, that God in himself ever was, and alwayes will be one and the same God, and not only in the latter times; Times and men may change, but our God is unchangeable. Can you or dare you contradict this evident truth?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this comfortable text is alledged and applied corruptly by Mr. <hi>Biddle. Zachary</hi>'s Prophesie is as he truly saith a gratious promise and an infallible prediction, that the happy days should come, when all Idol gods should be abolished, and that the name of the Lord should he one; that is, shall be acknowledged to be one, which is one in it self, that good and inlightened Christians shall be of one mind and heart in Religion, and in faith, that God shall alone be acknowledged and owned to be the true God, that he alone shall be worshipped with religious worship, alone invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and by faith relied on for salvation. Consider now how wisely you do make use of Scriptures to serve your purpose? God in this prophesie is taken essentially for God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost, and these three are one God, 1. <hi>John</hi> 5.7.</p>

                  <p>Secondly I answer, if (onely) be applyed to the Father in this holy Text, suppose it had run thus, onely the Father is the true God, yet doth not that attribution exclude the Son and the Holy Ghost, from being the true God: it is a rule in Logick, <hi>exclusiva particula subjecti non excludit concomitantia,</hi> or <hi>inclusa, id est,</hi> neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary accidents connexed, and necessary consequents, it is not sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply exclusive, but <hi>secundum quid,</hi> that is, it excludes not the Son and holy Ghost from being the true God, but all that are out of the Father <hi>sc,</hi> which are not true gods, so that all false gods which have been, are, or shall hereafter be devised are opposed to the true God, and some of our adversaries are forced to make use of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, saying, when the Scriptures say onely, <hi>the Lord God is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall, wise,</hi> these speeches do not exclude others from being wise and immortall, but that God is onely immortall and wise of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, so <hi>Volkelius</hi> and <hi>Schlichtingius,</hi> see <hi>Placeus lib.</hi> 2. <hi>Disput.</hi> 20. <hi>Christus est verus Deus.</hi> Now this title onely God, is attributed to the Father, in regard of order, and that gracious dispensation, which by consent of all three persons was vouchsafed for our salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore it is not said, 'tis life eternal to know thee to be God, but the onely true God, (and verily Christ is no idol god) to evidence that the gods of the Gentiles, are not truly but falsely called gods.

                  <p>Thirdly, observe it well, which is the most commonly received
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:118911:45"/>answer and clear in the Text, if the words had been an entire Axiome of themselves, as they are not, the Father is the onely true God, that <hi>exclusio non est ex parte suppositi, sed appositi,</hi> Hales <hi>de Trinit. q.</hi> 65. <hi>monitio.</hi> 3 <hi>artic. &amp;c.</hi> then there is <hi>fallacia compositionis,</hi> and the word, onely, is not confined to the subject.

                  <p>I will communicate to the Reader the Exposition of <hi>Gaspar Eras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Brockmand lib. de Deo Filio cap.</hi> 2. <hi>qu.</hi> 1. which he believes may be naturally given out of the Text, it is plain (saith he) in what sense Christ calls the Father the onely true God. Our Lord lifts up his eyes to heaven, and calls him Father, which presupposeth he hath a son, by the phrase then he teaching the Father to be the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true God, implyeth that he hath a Son, Omnipotent, Eternal, and which had glory with him, before the Creation of the world, <hi>v.</hi> 5. so that the very naming of God to be the true God, doth vertually infer the Son also to be true God, and take away the deity of the Son, and you have destroyed the definition of the Father: an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall Father must of necessity have a Son, which is eternall, in this sense also is Jesus Christ, called our onely Saviour, which surely excludes not the Father from being our Saviour, and yet might the Socinians conclude this latter, as well as the former.</p>
                  <p>This Text being thus cleared up, the Inferences will easily be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Infer.</hi> Christ (say you) setting down the persons necessarily to be known, if we look for eternal life, mentions not the Holy
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:118911:46"/>Ghost, and were he God, the knowledge of him would be as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary as of the Father.</p>
                  <p>To this I do answer, First that you do well to desert your Rabbins, which do assert without mentioning of the knowledge of Gods na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that obedience to Gods Commandements, and believing his promises, are the two parts of Christian Religion, and that in this Text, <hi>John</hi> 17.3. is not meant so much the knowledge of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as of his will; see <hi>Thornbeck, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de script. &amp; Religione cap.</hi> 9. <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, nor can this Text well stand with the Principles of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinianisme, which do willingly yield salvation to the Heathens, which conformed their lives according to the rules of their reason, in honouring a Deity, as well as they could, yea and to the holy ones in the old Testament without Christ, which utterly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the necessity of the Christian Religion, time was then and yet is, when this knowledge was not necessary.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I grant this assertion is true, without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and Christ, men of years cannot ordinarily be saved, but the Holy Text saith not, that a man knowing the Father and the Son, without knowledge of any other person may attain salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. These are necessary, but not onely these, a man must know himself to be in a damnable condition, which is not here expressed, and without which knowledge he cannot know God and Christ, <hi>viz.</hi> practically, which is here required, it cannot be proved, that all persons needfull to be known should be mentioned in every Text.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, I adde, it is very strange, that the Adversary having ascribed so much to the Holy Ghost, as he hath done, especially in the sixh Article, and third Argument against the Trinity, confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing him to be one of the persons of the holy Trinity, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioned in Gods word, should not be the object of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving faith, and that he should assert the knowledge of him not to be necessary to salvation, being our enlightner and our guide, seeing the Creed commonly called the Apostles, is with an unanimous consent approved by the Socinians, as they would have the world believe, as <hi>Jonas Schlichtingius,</hi> professeth in the name of the <hi>Polo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> Churches and names knowledge, as antecedent, and saith of the Trinity, naming God the Father, Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, I adde more clearly, albeit the holy Ghost is not mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed here, yet is he not excluded, the reason is, because he is not out
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:118911:46"/>of the Father, and the Sonne of God, as false and Idol gods are but in regard of the unity of the divine Nature, he is both in the first and second person in an admirable manner, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.3. the Father is called God, and Christ Lord, the Holy Ghost is included implicitly, as in the old Testament, the faithfull implicitly, though not explicitly called on the Father in the name of Christ, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.24. for as <hi>ex parte subjecti,</hi> knowledge is onely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, which is the primary and universall root of all saving know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, yet is not every knowledge sufficient, but that which is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective knowledge and practical, not onely in the head, but in the heart and life, as holy habits, repentance for sinnes committed, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly mindednesse, a holy and humble walking with God, are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to attain salvation: so also <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> for as the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of our Mediatour and peace-maker is added to the knowledge of God, because we can have no accesse to the Father, but by him, nor can he be savingly known without the Sonne, no more can the Father and the Son be known without the guidance, illumination, and sanctification of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>Whereas you say, if the Holy Ghost was God, to know him was as necessary, as to know God the Father. I deny this Inference to be generally and at all times true. Christ speaks of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which he was pleased to reveal before his passion and Ascensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; many things were reserved to be fully known by the pouring out of the Holy Ghost. Christ prayes here as a Priest not yet entred into the Sanctuary; so that it was not needfull to make expresse mention of the Holy Ghost; for in that state Christ manifested not the holy Ghost, but the holy Ghost rather manifest<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I answer, all Fundamentals of Christian Religion are not plainly, no, nor by necessary consequence set down in every Text touching God, it is sufficient to settle our belief, if it be clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed in, or soundly deduced out of other Scriptures, sundry truths are in severall places recorded, which are so disposed by Gods wise providence, that our attention and diligence in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Scripture with Scripture might be sharpned.

                  <p n="3">3.

The Apostle excludes all those made gods, not the Son and the Holy Ghost, he saith, not only the Father is God, nor that Christ only is that one Lord, so that the Adversary commits his usuall fallacy, <hi>A dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter.</hi> The Apostle in effect thus argueth, an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doll is not a God, why? because there is but one God, who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:118911:48"/>and cannot be represented by any image, he prevents an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject on of the Gentiles, which worshipped many gods, to which practise he opposeth the sound judgement of Christians, to us saith he, there is but one God, under that one God the Fathers Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Sonnes Dominion are comprehended; to us there is but one God, who is described by this effect, that he created all things, this is ascribed to the Father, he that is one God, yet is he not all, that is, that one God this is ascribed to the Father, as being first in order of subsisting, and of working, for the manner of working is alwayes agreeable to the order of fusisting the summe is, one God the Father is spoken by way of opposition and exclusion of other Gods but not in opposition to the Son and holy Ghost, for the Son and holy Ghost are not comprehended under the called Gods, but under the name of that one God.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Besides, 'tis not necessary, that the Father should be taken per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally, relatively, and restrictedly, as I have hither to granted, it may be taken absolutely, commonly and essentially, and not contra di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from the person of the Son and of the Holy Ghost, but for the three divine persons; and the Apostle mentions Jesus Christ, because he is the Mediatour, by whom we are reconciled to God, by whom we have accesse to God, and by whose works all good things are communicated to us, which Office could not have been performed by our Mediatour, unlesse he had been God-man.</p>
                  <p>How little advantage the Adversary hath from this Scripture, may appear by these Arguments grounded on the Text it self.</p>
                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p n="2">2. Christ is not a made Lord, as spoken of in this Text, but a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall, essentiall, and uncreated Lord, the reason is because all made Lords, as Angels, and Magistrates are spoken of v. 5. yet out of the number of these Christ is excepted, as all made Lords are opposed to the most high God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Apostle saith, Christ is one Lord, shall we from hence be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to conclude, that the Father is not our Lord! surely we may as firmly conclude, that God the Father is not our Lord, as we may
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:118911:48"/>infer, because we have one God the Father, therefore Christ is not our God, or to say, he is not God the Father, therefore he is not God, because he is distinguished from God, for why should not we as strongly infer, because the Father is distinguished from God, <hi>Hos.</hi> 1.7. <hi>I wil have mercy upon the house of</hi> Judah, <hi>and will save them by the Lord their God,</hi> as the Adversary doth the former.</p>

This is proved by the propositions of and by, and the effects, all thing are of God the Father, Christians have nothing, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they are Christians, but as they are creatures, which they have not from God, and as duty requireth they render thanks to God for all temporalls and spiritualls, and the Apostle saith, all things are by our Lord Jesus Christ, and so by consequence he is the highest God: he makes the particle (by) to be of the same extent, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually comprehensive in reference to its object, as the particle (of) <hi>Of the Father are all things,</hi> as if he had said, all things are of one God by one Lord, if some things had been by one God the Father, and other things by one Lord, the force of the Propositions and the order and connexion betwixt one God and one Lord would be lost, if that the Father create all things, by this Lord it shews, that this Lord is omnipotent, and the wonderfull diversity of the divine unity, and the unity of diversity: if the Father creates all things by the Son, if the Son be a creature he must be an instrument of his own Creation, and he must be before himself, which is a flat con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,</p>

                  <p>The end and scope of those words is not as you pretend, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the different nature, order, and dignity of three Persons of the holy Trinity, but to exhort the Christians to peace and concord by sundry Arguments and Motives. Three of them are taken from the Father, the Son, and the holy Ghost, as most men think.</p>
                  <p>First, there is one Spirit; and this you take for granted to be one Person, but you shall find strong Adversaries, if I mistake not their meaning, which do not understand the Holy Ghost, but the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle exhorts, as they are one body and Society of Christians, that they may have one Soul, as it were one spirit of love to animate that body, according to the hoped for eternall salvation (Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>) and it may be the order of the words, and placing the spirit with that which is not a person, imports so much, but I will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, for this sense being unusuall, nor will I rest in it.</p>
                  <p>Well then, this spirit is an uncreated spirit, and the Apostle useth a Rhetoricall gradation, proceeding from the third to the second,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:118911:49"/>and from the second to the first Person, and it may be, because the Spirit is the next Person of Unity; our Lord, as it were, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle cause, and one originall Father or beginning cause, as some Divines do speak.</p>
                  <p>By the Spirit is meant an uncreated Spirit, and this I prove, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this Spirit is in all, and as the Soul is to the body, so is this Spirit to the Church; the Spirit quickens every member of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, and governs it, which the most excellent Spirit being a finite substance cannot possibly do.</p>
                  <p>Your Argument, this Spirit cannot be God, because he is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from God, is as weak as water, for albeit in some respects he is called the Spirit, and by way of distinction the holy Spirit. yet this excludes not the Father and Son of God from being a spirit, and evident it is by the Text, that this Spirit is distinguished from God, <hi>viz.</hi> from God the Father, we are no <hi>Sabellians,</hi> but do maintain the distinction of Persons; the reason why the first Person is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in Scripture called God, is because he, as he is Father, is of himself, and the Principle of the Son and holy Ghost, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect many eminent Divines, as <hi>Calvin tit.</hi> 1. <hi>Institut. cap.</hi> 13. <hi>s.</hi> 23. <hi>Zanch. sepe To ult p.</hi> 884. <hi>Jun. praefat. ad Controv.</hi> 2. <hi>l. nota</hi> 18. <hi>Sotonius Bisterfield,</hi> and many others do say, that he is called God <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> by way of excellency, not Metaphysically or Logically, for a greater excellency; for there is no reall Prerogative or Intrinsecal Dignity, betwixt the divine Persons, but one extrinsecall in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of order and manifestation. Yet if the phrase is distasted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there is <hi>Summa &amp; unitissima essentiae identitas; origo essendi, nullam essentiae disparitatem, nullam dignitatis inaequalitatem introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit.</hi> They may omit it.</p>
                  <p>That Discourse of the Adversary, to prove that the Spirit is not a created Spirit, might wel have been spared for he knows wel enough that none of us do hold him to be a Creature, and least some suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might grow from the Adversaries alledging some Protestants, as <hi>Drusius, Beza, Mede,</hi> and I add Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> that they fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured his Exposition, I do avouch, albeit they disagreed to their Brethren in the exposition of that Text, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.4. yet do they all agree that the holy Spirit is infinite in all perfection: That he is no Creature. but the Creator of all things; the Angels do attend and wait on God by an allusion to the <hi>Sanhedrim;</hi> they are Officers waiting on the head or chief President therof, to go abroad in all
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:118911:50"/>Messages, or as the Deacons in the Church to attend on the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Governours thereof, and I do not deny, but there is an order in the Celestiall Angels, as there is also among the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, and that some have greater illumination, power and imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, then others have, though we are not able exactly to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish them.</p>
                  <p>To the second, Christ is one Lord, I answer, Christ in respect of his person, is an unmade Lord: he is the Son of God co-eternall, and co-essentiall with his Father, he could not give the Spirit unless he was God, and if there were two Lords of Christians, the Father and Christ, the Apostle had not soundly argued to prove that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians should maintain unity, nor can it be said, that Christ is one Lord simply by way of excellency, for according to Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> he hath the supreme God to be his Lord, but by way of co-essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality, and Lordship with the Father, he is one Lord with him, and by consequence one God with him.</p>
                  <p>It is said indeed v. 6. that the Father is above all, but the exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive particle (above) appears not in the Text, for that is an honour belonging to the three persons equally, which are one God by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is a rule, when that which is common to more then one is attributed to one person, that hinders not, but the same belongs to them also, and if it should be restrained to the Father, it would be no advantge to the Socinian, being spoken in regard of divine dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation, whereby the Son of God became the Son of man, he that is above all as he is God, the same is made man the Son of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> the Son of <hi>David,</hi> the Son of a Virgin, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem us by his bloudy Passion, thus is he the head and husband of the Church, his body and Spouse, in which respect he is inferiour to God the Father.</p>
                  <p>You tell us out of <hi>Acts</hi> 2. that this Son is made Lord and Christ.</p>
                  <p>I answer in the words of <hi>Beza,</hi> This Text is impiously and foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledged by the <hi>Arians,</hi> against the Deity of our Saviour, for in the whole context the Apostle speaketh of Christ according to the flesh, as he was crucified, dead, buried, raised from the dead, as he ascended into heaven, and was highly exalted at Gods right hand, he was before a Lord, <hi>you call me Lord and Master, and you say well, for so I am.</hi> Joh 13.13. and he was Christ, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.16. <hi>Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God,</hi> and for this Confession, Christ blessed <hi>Peter,</hi> but the full manifestation &amp; evident execution of his domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:118911:50"/>was after his Ascension. You argue thus, Christ is a made Lord, and therefore he is not an omnipotent and an uncreated Lord. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny your Inference, it is a common fallacy of the Adversary to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <hi>à dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter,</hi> as if that was abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely and simply to be taken, which is meant onely in a certain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, and expounded by a limitation, he was not a made Lord, as he was God, the Son of God by eternall generation, this is grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the Adversary concludes because he was a made Lord, and had dominion freely given him, as man, therefore he is onely a made Lord, (and observe that his Text, saith not, nor any other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that he is a made God) this no way follows from the Text, for <hi>Peter</hi> takes away the scandall of Christs Crosse, by shewing that he being raised from the dead, was made Lord, set at Gods right hand as the head of the Church, that God instated him in the Kingly office of the Messias, to conquer his enemies, to gather, direct, rule and protect the Church, as a King, and as a Priest to make intercession for his chosen ones, the Dominion then of Christ, which is freely given to him, and considered absolutely in it self, is lesse then that of the Deity, because it implies not an intrinsecall and necessary perfection, but that which is extrinsecall and free, but if it be considered according to its originall, then is it equall to the Deity, comprehends it, and necessarily supposeth it, and is nothing else but a singular manner of executing the naturall dominion: the Adversaries fallacy is like this, a man is mortall and visible, <hi>viz.</hi> touching his body, <hi>Ergo</hi> he is not immortall and visible touching his soul.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. To the objected testimonies, I have two answers in readinesse, the first is of learned <hi>Junius,</hi> in two places against <hi>Samosatenus,</hi> and in his Annotations on <hi>Bellarmine</hi> on that Scripture, and therefore we may not doubt, but he spoke it as his clear judgement upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation; the words of our Saviour are not (faith he) sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to be understood, but upon supposition of their judgement, which took him to be a meere man, though an excellent Prophet sent from God; if he was such an one as they took him to be, then certainly, he did not know of himself when the day of Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should be, so that in the name of the Son mentioned by by Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> there is a tacite opinion betwixt the truth of his person, and their defective and erroneous opinions concerning him, as though he had not been the eternal Son of God, and the most high God, but onely a divine man, and on this ground, God the Father is taken in opposition to all the creatures, and thus our blessed Saviour, checks the young man, <hi>Luke</hi> 18. for saying, <hi>good Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life! Why</hi> (saith he) <hi>dost thou call me good? there is none good but God,</hi> the young man did not acknowledge Christ to be the God of Israel, and the good Mr. pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised in the Law, and therefore Christ doth implicitly reprove his ignorance and flattery, and forms his answer agreeable to that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion he had of him, as <hi>Basil. contra Eunomium. Ambros. tit.</hi> 2. <hi>de Fide Chrysost. in Matth.</hi> 19. <hi>Hilar. l.</hi> 9. <hi>de Trinitate,</hi> do truly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound that Scripture, for in a true sense he not onely admits it, but calls himself the good Shepherd, <hi>John</hi> 10.1. and how should he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly deny himself to be a good master, who calls himself the light of the world? and this was his reason of the answer of that vain question of the mother of the sons of <hi>Zebedee, Grant that these my two sons may sit, one of them at thy right hand, and the other at thy left hand in thy Kingdome,</hi> Mat. 19 They commonly then had a carnal conceit of the Kingdom of Christ, &amp; he shapes an answer suitable to their apprehension, in this sense many other Texts of Scripture are to be understood, <hi>John</hi> 7.16. and 5.30.8.50. and 59. <hi>ex Bisterfeldio,</hi> this exposition I only propound to the consideration of the Reader, I omit the conceit of <hi>Grotius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> that the Chapter speaks onely of the Jews, and the forerunning signes of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of that State by <hi>Titus,</hi> which if true, would not untie the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:118911:51"/>knot, but tie it faster, as also many solutions; which are alledged by others, which cannot in truth stand with the Holy Text.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 The Satisfactory answer is this, Christ represseth the Disciples curiosity of enquiring of that day, testifying, that neither he, the Angels, nor Christ, as he is man, but as he is one with the Father, knows when that day shall be, and therefore you are not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitive after it.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Son, the Text is not meant <hi>secundum totam perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam,</hi> but <hi>totum personae,</hi> knows it not. The person of Christ knows all things, but the whole of the person knows not all things, not when the end of the world should be, and therefore Saint <hi>Mark</hi> saith not, the Son of God, knows not, as <hi>Cyril</hi> out of <hi>Athanasius,</hi> well observes, but onely the Son knows not, <hi>viz.</hi> as he was man. <hi>Melancthon</hi> hath a rule, some sayings of Christ are meant of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, some of the essence of Christ. This is meant of the Office, Christ came to exhort to vigilancy, &amp; not to define the hour of Judegment to prevent security; the exclusive particle excludes all creatures, and the soul of Christ in it self considered, for albeit there was no privative, no sinfull ignorance in the humane nature of Christ, yet was three negative ignorance, as there was in <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of innocency, and as there is in Angels and Saints in heaven. Christ was like us in all things, but onely in sinfull infirmities, Heb. 4.15. the nescience of that day of doom was no sin. Christ knew all things, which were requisite for him to know touching his present state and condition, nor is this convincing, because it is said onely the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther knows, for is it not said, that none know the Father but the Son, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.27. Will you from this Text conclude, that the Father knoweth not himself? and doth not the holy Ghost know the Father? the Apostle saith, <hi>the things of God knoweth</hi>

                     <hi>none, but the Spirit of God.</hi> Might not you as strongly conclude from hence, that neither the Father himself, nor the Son of God do know the things of God. Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> addes not a higher degree then Angels, he saith not the Angels know not, nor the Holy Ghost, whence we may collect the Holy Ghost knew when the day of Judgement should be, and consequently Christ, as God, was not ignorant of it, and this is proved by <hi>Athanasius orat.</hi> 4. <hi>contr. Aria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos</hi> and by others, because he made all things, and so knows all things, he is a searcher of all hearts, because he knew and foretold the signes foregoing the last day.

                  <p>To your objection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.6. the answer is, by discord God the Father is much dishonoured, and by concord he is much honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and 'tis the duty of Jews and Gentiles, unanimously to serve and worship, and hereby to glorifie God the Father. What then? will it from hence follow negatively, that neither the Son of God, nor the Holy Ghost, are the most high God, in no wise, for herein all the holy persons agree, as we do maintain and you cannot be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of it, this you should, but you cannot disprove, you may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed from hence conclude, that God the Son is not God the Father, and that the name (God) for some respects, is attributed to the Father; which have been formerly named, and 'tis needlesse to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat them, but no more can be justly inferred from the Scripture.</p>
                  <p>To the second place, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.9. it is answered, as to the former, it is a grosse sin in a Christian, with the tongue to confesse God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to revile Christian Brethren, who are for Gods image, which they are adorned withal, to be looked upon and used with all tender love and kindnesse.</p>

                  <p>To the third place, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.27. labour not, study not to gain and possesse these externall things, in order to your worldly ends, which are of a fading and perishing nature, but for that food, the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall promises, the food of the soul, which will make all of them that feed on it, spiritually both glorious &amp; for ever happy, he dehorts from the one, and exhorts to the other, then follows a description of Christ our Mediator, who hath a Commission under Seal (as it were) from God his Father, being furnished with admirable gifts and wonderfull power, and by sending the Holy Ghost on him, he had Gods mark, and character stamped on him, as was somewhere done by Masters on their slaves, and by owners of commodities, on their wares, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.3. and that God owned him to be his servant, is as evident, as if he had set his mark on him in the forehead for his own: now this blessed Son of God incarnated for us, merited life, and all happinesse for us by his bitter Passion, and efficaciously conferred saving graces on our souls by his holy Spirit, enabling us being otherwise unable to receive the benefits of his death and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; this passage of holy Scripture religiously considered, makes much for us, and strongly proves our Saviour to be God, for who but God can give unto us eternal life?</p>
                  <p>In these three places (saith Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi>) God the most high God, is interpreted to be God the Father, and therefore none but he can be God, not to contend about one of the places which is questio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably, whether it be taken personally or not, I grant, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in three places, but in sixteen at least, God is expresly named with this <hi>exgesis,</hi> God even the Father; and 'tis said almost in as many places, if some learned have not erred in their account, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conjunction copulative, God the Father, hence you conclude, that none but he can be God, which words may admit a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.

Father notes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his Son, and God the absolute Essence, your reason is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, arguing from the affirmation of particular to the negation of that which is more common. The Father is God, and therefore the Son is not God, it is no better then thus to conclude, <hi>Peter</hi> is an Apostle, and, therefore <hi>John</hi> is not an Apostle; the words in the Text, are to be understood relatively, for it is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son

                  <p n="1">1.

                  <p>Secondly, because it is said, in the Context, v. 58. <hi>Before Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham was, I am,</hi> as God, he was a preserver of his Church, before <hi>Abraham, who saw my day and rejoyced,</hi> he received benefits by me and rejoyced not with an ordinary joy, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The second place may be granted without any prejudice to the truth of God, and that <hi>in terminis,</hi> as your inference intends, one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is a question what is meant by forefathers, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. all the Latine Fathers, saith <hi>Espenceus,</hi> do expound the Text of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Prophets, and do ascend up to <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> and if progenitours nearer to him are understood, those I mean, with whom he was educated; the meaning is plainly thus much, he ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved God without known hypocrisie, and was touching moralities unblameable towards men in his conversation, even when through ignorance he persecuted the Christian Faith, then did he follow the dictates of his erroneous conscience, doing, as he was perswaded he ought to do.</p>
                  <p>I answer to your three places taken out of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apostles, by reducing your reason to this form, as you seem to argue.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. The Mijor in some sense might be granted, but because it may be incommodiously understood, I answer, It is not generally, and without exception true, it is faulty, because the Subject of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position is more large then the Predicate, which the Rules of Art, Axioms, will not permit, the Predicate is the Father of Christ, now th it is singular, one person, but to be the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> is common, and belongs equally to God the Father God the Son and God the Holy Ghost, if you will convert the Termes thus, The Father of our Lord Christ, is the Father of <hi>Abraham, Isa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> who will then deny it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There is committed the usuall fallacy, a <hi>Dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter,</hi> he argues from the affirmation of one person which is singular to a negation of that which is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the Father is God, therefore you would infer the Son is not God, who sees not the fallacy, is this a good reasoning, <hi>Peter</hi> is a man, and therefore <hi>John</hi> is not a man.</p>
                  <p>To your Argument then, I answer, though the term (God) ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken simply and absolutely, without limitation, distinguisheth not betwixt the Father and the Son, yet God taken in a restrained sense, as it is frequently in the Scripture, for one of the glorious persons of the Holy Trinity, thereby one of them is distinguished from the other. The Father is not the Son, it is yielded, and yet to affirm one of the Sacred Persons to be the God of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it to be true of another, is a false assertion, Jesus Christ, who was truly man, though not as man, was the God of <hi>Abraham, Isaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and he visibly appeared to them, yea, and <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> might truly have said, as <hi>David</hi> did many generations after him. <hi>The Lord said to my Lord, sit thou at my right hand,</hi> Psal. 110. in effect then, this is your Inference, if the Son of God be not the Father, and <hi>Paul</hi> worshipped the same God, which his forefathers did, <hi>Ergo</hi> the Son is not God.

                  <p>It is not in the general denyed, but most frequent both in Scripture and common use, to speak in the plural number, when a singular person is onely intended, albeit your Scriptures alledged, are no sufficient proofs thereof.</p>
                  <p>Note <hi>John</hi> the 3.11. We know Christ discourseth with <hi>Nicodemus</hi> touching regeneration. The Father and the Holy Ghost regenerates, the holy Disciples were also witnesses hereof, <hi>John</hi> 15.27. and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, so that albeit the Son of God, the prime interpreter of the Father spake thus, yet is not his unity of Person onely meant there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, but Christ together with these forenamed, are included.</p>
                  <p>Note <hi>Mar.</hi> 4.30. <hi>Wherunto shall we liken,</hi> viz. Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and 35. he saith, let us passe over.

<pb n="91" facs="tcp:118911:56"/>words of the learned Placers, <hi>p.</hi> 2. <hi>Arg.</hi> 37. it is an unusuall thing amongst the Greeks and Latines, for single men which are in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and dignity to speak of themselves in the plural number, but it is unusuall and unheard of amongst the Hebrews, whence this testimony is fetched. No man in the old Testament, no man placed in highest dignity, no Priest, no Judge, no King, doth ever speak of himself in the plural number.</p>
                  <p>The Adversaies mistrusting the strength of this Argument, which is appointed by his brethren, and fortified by the alledged Scriptures and others also, confesseth that God speaketh to another Person. Well then, this divine Consultation, as Divines were wont to speak, or rather which is agreeable to truth, this Exhortation, for it is not said, What, <hi>Shall we make man?</hi> the other creatures being made, Gods glory, and the perfection of the world required the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of man, this Exhortation I say, argues plurality of persons, and that God doth not speak of himself for his great honour and Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty in the plural number, we say that Gods manner of speaking is of great moment, and we have cause to magnifie his wisdome for using such a speech as should be fit to expresse the mystery of the Holy Trinity, but the Adversary resolves, that God spake to a created Spirit, separated in nature from the most high God, and which was his instrument, in that admirable work of the Creation of man, but how do you prove it? by <hi>Psalm</hi> 104.30. and <hi>Job</hi> 26.13.</p>
                  <p>I answer first, that these Scriptures do not bear witnesse to this wicked assertion, that the Spirit was Gods instrument in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but that he created the world by the Spirit, that is, say we, according to the Scriptures, the Holy Ghost acted by the same om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent power, whereby the Father made the world, because he hath the same infinite Essence with the Father and Son of God, although he hath it not in the same order and manner.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Your Argument taken from the particle (by) to prove the Holy Ghost to be an instrument of the Creation is very weak, and by consequence would reduce the most high God, so acknowledged to be by the Adversary himself, into the rank of an instrumentall cause, for it is expresly said, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>By him are all things,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 19. <hi>By whom we are called to the fellowship of Jesus Christ,</hi> and Paul <hi>was an Apostle by God the Father,</hi> Galatians 1.1. and therfore seeing all things are by the Father, and all things are by the Holy Ghost, they are the same principle of all things, and this
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:118911:57"/>particle according to diverse subjects spoken of admitting various senses, can afford no sound plea for the Adversary.</p>
                  <p>You tell us that the spirit was mentioned in the second verse of <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. true, and that he created man, no man amongst us doubts it, it would much have furthered your cause, if you could have proved (which is impossible to be done) that God crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Spirit, which is mentioned in that place, <hi>v.</hi> 2 there are not the least footsteps of any such matter; till this be done, our Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on your concession remains unanswerd, you prove what is not denyed, and take for granted what should be proved, that our fellow servant, and fellow creature, would be our Creatour; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, God created all other kinds of Creatures at once, as Fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, Beasts, Birds—What reason can you give, why he created not all Angels at once? it is true, <hi>Adam</hi> was first created, then our mother <hi>Eve</hi> out of him, but that was done for a great myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to shew the great love which ought to be betwixt the Husband and wife, and the near conjunction betwixt them, which hath no place in the Creation of Angels, for they being immortall Spirits do neither marry, nor are given in marriage. Furthermore, if God created not all things but by the ministry of a Creature, it is either because he could not create without him, so to assert was high blasphemy, to deny the Almighty Power of God, and unreasonable also to think, that he who created the most excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lept creature, <hi>viz.</hi> the Holy Ghost. I speak like the Adversary, could not he create those creatures, which are inferiour to him, without an Instrument, or else was it, because God would not? whereas his very will to create was to make the creature. <hi>He spake the Word, and they were made:</hi> if you say, his will was by the Holy Ghost, to create other things, and so use him as an Instrument. Surely the Scripture hath no such language, either in termes or by equivalence, and how can we believe, there was any such thing without Scripture shew your reasons, every wise man may justly expect, (if you will forsake the beaten road of Interpreters) that you should shew fair evidences for your learning this beaten path, which is tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den generally by all the most eminent in parts and piety.</p>

It is to be observed that God speaketh to the persons which are equall. <hi>Let us make man in our image,</hi> he saith not in the plural number, let us make man after our images, nor after my likenesse, but our likenesse, if then God had spoken to a created Angel, an Angel should be a Samplar and an archetype, and we should be made not onely after the image of God, but of an Angel, its true, men and Angels are like in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, yet is it no where said, that man is made after the image of an Angel, and <hi>Eve</hi> was like <hi>Adam,</hi> yet is she not said to be made after the image of <hi>Adam</hi> but of God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27.32. yea beasts are like men in many things, yet are they not made alter the image of man. Further, the Text saith not in the plural number they made, but God made man, that we might take notice of the unity of the Godhead, and the plurality of persons.

                     </gap> the words run thus, <hi>creavit Elohim,</hi> where are four things to be observed for the streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thening of this Argument. First, that the word hath a singular number <hi>Eloah,</hi> and there was simply no necessity to use the plurall number in the Hebrew tongue, unlesse this mystery was implyed. Secondly, because there was danger of errour, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to use the plural number, if there had been onely one divine person. Thirdly, nor can the like example and <hi>Enallage</hi> in all the old Testament be alledged of the like construction with the affixes and other verbs, as with <hi>Elohim</hi> compare <hi>Josh.</hi> 24.9. <hi>Deuteron.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Jer.</hi> 10.10. <hi>Gen.</hi> 20.13. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.2. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.23. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 17.21, See <hi>Hornebeck de Deo. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. <hi>sect.</hi> 2. Lastly, because we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the propriety of the word, which is of the plural number, <hi>Gerhar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the invalidity of this reasoning appears, because there is no mention in it, that the holy Angels were created in the first of <hi>Genesis,</hi> and yet other Texts say, that the heavens and the earth were finished and all their hosts, <hi>Gen</hi> 2.1. much lesse is it said, that the Holy Ghost, was made when as the Anglls are expresly said to be made by Christ, <hi>Col</hi> 1.16. but never in Scripture is it said, that the Holy Ghost was made.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, albeit it is not mentioned in the first of <hi>Genes.</hi> that the Son of God was the Creatour, will it not suffiice, if it be expresly mentioned as it is in other Texts of holy writ, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ob.</hi> To prevent an objection, when Creation is ascribed to the Son in the Scripture, it is meant saith the Adversary of the new Creation, to this I answer, 'tis apparently false, not onely because all the blessed ones from the Creation to the incarnation of the Son of God, were by him regenerated and saved, and not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly those which lived after his birth and Passion, which evinceth that he had a being before the Creation, according to that rule <hi>non

                  <p>The Case of Conscience propounded, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19. was, whether it was lawfull for a man by a Bill of divorce to put away his wife, which by the Jews upon every slight occasion was usually done: Our Saviours answer is negative, shewing the strict union and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction betwixt man and wife, the knot of marriage being tied is indissoluble, but by daeth and adultery. God made them male and female, to be one flesh. By this your concession then, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost a creature, was not instrumentall to this work of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency; not a creature, but God, saith our Saviour, made them male and female; therefore you do infer onely the Father, as he is distinguished from the Son? have you the forehead, to say that we question whether God made <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve?</hi> if in every place of Scripture where God is mentioned, the first person is onely meant, you will have good store of Arguments indeed against the Deity of the Son and the Holy Ghost, but do you expect that your bare word should be taken for a solid proof? I answer then, that God in many places of Scriptures, and in this, is taken essentially, not
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:118911:59"/>personally, as the infinite Creatour distinct from all the Creatures, because the word is taken absolutely, and not as distinguished from the Son of God, albeit I grant the relation to the Father, is not simple, but a mixt habitude, to wit of subordination, in respect of his humane nature, and so he created not <hi>Adam,</hi> and co-ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in regard of the Divine nature, and in this notion, he together with his Father created <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> and all things.</p>
                  <p>To the second place in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> I answer by a distinction, that in some respects he was foreknown, and in others he was not, and so, this seeming absurdity and contradiction comes to nothing, he was preordained, <hi>viz.</hi> to be our Mediatour, in the fulnesse of time to become man, that he might expiate our sins by his bitter passion, and procure eternall life for the elect of God, and in this sense S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> speaketh of Christ, as both the Text and context sheweth, and thus I yield he had not a being till these latter times, but now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider Christ simply as a divine person, and as he was simply himself the Son of God, and in this respect I do deny that he was foreknown, for in this Consideration he did himself foreknow and elect, and had an infinite being before all times by eternal generation.</p>
                  <p>To the third place <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. the answer is easie, observe that to be a Type of any person, is to prefigure him either by nature or institu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of God or man, <hi>Adam</hi> was not a type of Christ by nature, or the institution of man, but by Gods appointment. <hi>Adam</hi> was the authour of death to all his posterity, not onely to men of years, but Infants also died in him, and herein he did prefigure Christ, who was by his free and rich grace the authour of life to all believers, herein was manifested Gods rich mercy and love for ever to be ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, which wisely found a way to find in sin a blessed remedie, in death, life, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:118911:60"/>and perfect man. Now <hi>Adam</hi> was not a type of him in regard of them both, not a type of him as he was God, for so he did pre-exist before him, but onely as he was a Mediatour in our humane nature; <hi>Adam</hi> was created by him, as he was God, but he was after him as he was man: <hi>Adam</hi> was a type of him, as he was incarnated to save us, the person of Christ which is single, and but one, did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes subsist, but not in the humane nature hypostatically united to the second person.

Loe here lies a lump of earth, that would needs become like God: here lies the Glow-worm, that would needs become a Sun. Lastly, this sense is held forth by the whole context. <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> heard the voyce of Jehovah walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the garden, <hi>v.</hi> 8. and Jehova called unto <hi>Adam, v.</hi> 9. and he the same Lord said, <hi>v.</hi> 11. and alwayes in the singular number in the foregoing Verses, <hi>Hast thou eaten of the Tree, which I commanded thou shouldest not eat of it,</hi> and v. 12. <hi>the woman which thou gavest me,</hi> &amp;c. the Lord God sent him out of the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> so that we adore the mystery of the Trinity, and the unity of the Divine Essence, and if we yield to the Adversaries, that the words are not spoken by an Ironie, but properly will this any way advantage them? for whom was <hi>Adam</hi> like unto? the Devils? who dares say God joyneth the Devils with himself, saying by the Pronoune Us, or like to the good Angels, but by eating the forbidden fruit, he became unlike them in knowledge, for he fell into errour; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like them in holinesse, for he became a sinner, unlike them in hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, for he became miserable: or shall we say like to God ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:118911:61"/>considered? but by this fact he became most unlike him, God saith not, he is like the Angels, or he is like God, or he is like us, but he is like one of us, as <hi>Placens</hi> observeth; he is not like the Father, nor like the Holy Ghost, but like the Son of God, for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was a shadow and type of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. which is like the body, and that which it shadoweth out. <hi>Adam</hi> became miserable, and knew good and evil experimentally, the Son of God that he might save us, took upon him our sorrows, that he might renew Gods image in us, and therefore <hi>Eve</hi> is not named, but onely the woman, till God had pronounced his Sentence against <hi>Adam,</hi> and this is also the reason why God so mercifully dealt with <hi>Adam,</hi> and testified it by saying, behold the man is not like us, but one of us, and why he spoke to <hi>Adam</hi> alone and not to <hi>

                  <p>Gen. 11.7. <hi>Let us go down and confound their language,</hi> in the former verse, the wicked are opposed to the sons of God mentioned <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>v.</hi> 2: and they do encourage one another to build and finish that great and foolish work in hand. God the Father speaks to the Son and the Holy Ghost, these sinners wilfully persist in their presumptuous enterprise to finish it it, or by way of interrogation to this effect it is an unworthy work tending to our dishonor, should they not be restrained, or the holy Trinity mutually (as it were) exhorteth to blast the resolution of these wicked men, and to bring on them that evil, which they endevoured to prevent, v. 8. and speaking after the manner of men determineth to overthrow the vain determination of foolish men. <hi>Let us go down and confound their language,</hi> in which words observe first, that God speaks in the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral number, let us come, let us go down and confound, where there cannot be an <hi>Enallage</hi> of the number, that the plural number is put for the singular, because as <hi>Keckerman</hi> sheweth, that this is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Hebrew tongue to speak in the first person, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (one) will not bear it, God speaks here, and we never read in Scripture, that God said, come, let us do this—. <hi>Gostavius</hi> his Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry could not alledge a contrary example to either of the Arguments,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:118911:61"/>but was silent. Observe further, that God speaks to more, as to equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by nature, as the builders, said everyone to his neighbour, let us build without having authority and power one over another, but as fellow-builders to their fellow-builders, so when God said, come let us go down, he speaks not as having power and authority over them to whom he speaks, but as one of their number, which should have a hand in that great work, or as if it could not be done, but without their consent and concurrence, there appears then in the words no command, he saith not in the Imperative Mood do you go down, do you confound, but let us go down, let us confound, so that he useth them not as servants, but as equals. Besides, those to whom God speaks have power to confound languages, this is a peculiar work of God in an instant to make them forget their mothers tongue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out external violence, and at the same instant to teach them other languages, this is not the work of Angels, much lesse of one created Angel to do, it is God that taketh away speech, <hi>Job</hi> 12.20. thus then we argue. He that in this manner confounds the language is true God, others with the Father do confound the language, <hi>Ergo</hi> others with the Father, are the true God. Besides, the word, let us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scend, is to be taken in one sense as spoken of these persons; for God doth otherwise descend then an Angel or Angels, for he (who is every where) descends improperly, but they being finite may properly descend from heaven: besides the dispersion of men on the face of the earth, is in the following verses ascribed to God, and that three times, and spoken of him in the singular number, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to shew the unity of the God-head: It is sayd, God came down, v. 4. and <hi>Genes.</hi> 19.24. which place the Adversary willingly omitted, the Lord rained fire and brimstone, from the Lord on <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> which as the Adversary confesseth in his Text, reason against the Trinity, is a proper name of God.</p>

<pb n="102" facs="tcp:118911:62"/>with the Scriptures, <hi>Josh.</hi> 14.19. <hi>Joshuah</hi> saith, <hi>ye cannot serve the Lord, quoniam Dii sancti sunt,</hi> according to the originall, he is a holy God, the reason why they could not serve God, is drawn from his holinesse, the Pronouns and Elogies are of the singular num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, lest there should be thought to be a plurality, as of divine persons, so of God, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.23. <hi>What Nation in the earth is like thy people,</hi> whom <hi>Dii iverant,</hi> God went to redeem for a people for himself.

<pb n="103" facs="tcp:118911:62"/>a created person, or an uncreated person and this person is the holy Ghost, this is a bold interpretationinvented without any colour of reason to support it and unhard of, if I be not mistaken, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against all the Orthodox, but also against the old <hi>Arians,</hi> which la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured in vain to disprove the Deity of the Son of God by the 22. v. of that Chapter. See <hi>Sixtin. Arianus in locum,</hi> and against most of the later Socinians, who by the wisdome of God conceive a divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to be meant, whereby the Father is formally wise, whereby he wisely createth and ruleth all things, <hi>By whom Kings do rule</hi> and make wise Laws, <hi>Gratian prosper. lib.</hi> 2. and <hi>Catechis. Cracoviensis page</hi> 59. others do explain it as meant of the Doctrine of the old Testament, or the Gospel of Jesus Christ, but to assert the holy Ghost, is this wisdome to make the disjunction full. Now I think I have dreamed, to say this wisdome was created, and the beginning of Gods Creation before Gods works of old, is by consequence to assert, that the most excellent part of the Creation was then past.</p>
                  <p>When in the beginning God made heaven and earth, as <hi>Moses</hi> describes it, the holy Ghost was made before, by whom all things were afterwards created, who taught at any time such strange Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity? where is any such thing recorded in any part of Scripture? who is so shamelesse to say, he hath it by divine revelation, who is so senselesse as to believe him that will say so?</p>

                  <p>That Christ is meant by wisdome, appears by the Text it self and parallel Scriptures, where the same is ascribed to the Son of God, which is spoken of Wisdome, <hi>v</hi> 24. for <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>You would prove your Exposition, by <hi>Isa.</hi> 11.2. where the Spirit is called the Spirit of wisdome.</p>
                  <p>To this I answer, first, that in the <hi>Proverbs</hi> is not mentioned the Spirit of wisdome, the Adversary then fallaciously compares Texts as like which are unlike.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Holy Ghost is called the Spirit of wisdome, not <hi>formaliter,</hi> but <hi>effectivè,</hi> there is a great deal of difference betwixt these two, Christ is Wisdome, that is, Substantiall Wisdome, and the holy Ghost is the Spirit of Wisdom, that is, the authour of Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome this doth the Holy Ghost hold forth in <hi>Isa.</hi> and no more,</p>
                  <p>Touching 7, 8, 9. Chapters of the Wisdome of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and 1. and 24. of <hi>Ecclesiasticus,</hi> by wisdome is meant an excellent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and that creature is the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>First, I answer, these books are Apochryphal, they are no rules of our faith, we are not then bound without better Authority to believe any thing upon the bare authority of these authors.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Not onely Christian <hi>Beckman,</hi> but learned <hi>Junius,</hi> a great deal more quick sighted then you are, hath proved from chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:118911:63"/>7. v. 21. and in the following verses of that chap. and in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 8. the deity of the Son of God, and of the holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Siracides</hi> speaks not of uncreated wisdome, but of created, <hi>viz.</hi> Gods wise ordering of things, created, and the Doctrine of the Law revealing supernatural knowledge, <hi>Acts Chapter</hi> 24.23. and the Wisdome by which true Wisdome may be obtained, he imitated <hi>Salomon</hi> but understood him not. 4. And when it was said that wisdome was created v. 8, 9. if this be not meant of created wisdome, which is a quality <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>Lastly, if in a few places, and in authours which are not canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, it were granted, that by wisdome was meant the holy Ghost, doth it follow that it must be so taken in the eight of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> I suppose no wise man will allow of the Inference.</p>

                  <p>I grant that the word Makers doth suppose not many qualities in one person, but more persons then one, and I grant also, that as there is an order of subsisting, so is there likewise of working, and this is communicated to the holy Ghost from the Father and Son of God, not in time, as you say, but from all Eternity, he not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king man, as you do blasphemously write by a subordinate causality to the first person, but by one and the same infinite power, and if a creature had been imployed at that great work, it would have been solely wrought by God at the presence of the creature, not by any innate or derived power of causality in a creature to that Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and so upon the matter it would have been God alone, and no active motion of any creature which had a hand causally in that Creation.

                  <p>M. <hi>Biddle,</hi> addes that Christ is the second cause of all things pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our salvation, this in his sense is absolutely denyed; we deny not an order in the working of the Trinity, in which respect and not in regard of a different power of working, the Father may be said to be the first cause, as the beginner, the Son the second cause, as the continuer of the action, and the Holy Ghost the next or third cause consummating it, yet all of them are truly but one solitary cause in regard of perfection and power of working, but social in regard of union and communion, because one cannot be, or work without the rest. <hi>Bisterfield</hi> against <hi>Crettius:</hi> but I deny that the Father is the principal efficient cause, as it is opposed to the lesse principal, whether it be instrumentall or ministeriall, as some distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish, for the lesse principal requires these conditions. 1. That it be under a superiour Agent by which it is ordered and directed, and the second is, that it hath a proper causality and influence into the effects of the first cause, for otherwise it is not an efficient cause. 3. That the causality be dependent and inferiour as a second cause, for the first being is essentially, and quidditatively more perfect then the second: the distinction of first and second cause takes place in God, who is the first cause, <hi>&amp; causa causarum,</hi> and the creatures which in respect of God are the second causes, but God the Father is not the first cause properly, and Christ the second cause, whether he be considered simply as God, or relatively, as the naturall Son of God, and if we speak of his Mediatory works, wrought for our salvation, the Principle whence their merit and vertue of satisfaction ariseth, is absolutely, the Divine Essence which is one and the same in all the three Persons, and thus are the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons co-ordinate in this work, as those magnificent titles import, that he is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>The Adversary saith, that the Son of God is the intermediate object of Faith and Worship ambiguously spoken, this should have been explicated and cleared up, how Christ, who in his opinion a meere creature can be the object of these Religious Acts, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally since he cannot be ignorant what sharp conflicts there have bin amongst themselves touching this subject, as <hi>Franciscus, Davidis, Budnius, Christianus Franker,</hi> and others, which do determine, that it is flat idolatry to pray unto Christ with Religious Worship, for as they say well, this honour is most properly due to the most high God, and thus they strongly reason, as great as the distance is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Creatour and the Creature, so great ought that difference to be betwixt that honour which is exhibited to the Creatour and to the Creature, but their distance is greatest, whether their nature or Dignity and Excellency be considered; they then that take away the formall cause or Foundation of Religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, The Deity of our Saviour, cannot justly thus worship him; See <hi>Hornbeck apparat. ad Controv.

Besides, if Christ was onely a second cause, he was not to be trusted in, nor to be worshipped, because the second Cause is in the Power of the first, its being life, Knowledge, Will, Power, Action may be destroyed, changed and hindred at the Will and Pleasure of the first and principall Cause, and that heart that trusts in the second Cause, departs from the Living Lord, <hi>Jeremy</hi> 17.5. nor can this be safely done, for he in whom we trust, must be a Searcher a Knower of our Hearts, Prayers, Dangers, be able to help us in our greatest Straits, and be present with us in all places, and at all times: to ascribe these to any creature, is to rob God of the Glory due to his Majesty.

                  <p>There are no doubt, many reasons which may be alledged touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this divine choice, though not such, as will convince an obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Adversary, why the Son of God, and not the Father and the blessed Spirit should become the Son of man, and this in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension was most congruous for such reasons as these are. 1. It becomes not the Father, <hi>Lombar. l.</hi> 3. <hi>distin.</hi> 1. for Incarnation is a kind of mission into the world, for he being of none, could not be sent by any, to send him is inconsistent with the most ordinate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitude and emanution of the divine persons, and the most natural order saith <hi>Bisterfield:</hi> nor was it fit for the holy Ghost to become the Son of man, but the name of Son should be attributed to two divine Persons in the holy Trinity, much lesse for the same cause should the Father become the Son of man, <hi>August. de dogmat. Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. cap.</hi> 2 <hi>Aquin.</hi> 3 <hi>par. qu.</hi> 3. and albeit the holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son, yet is he not the first proceeding Person, the first proceeding Person was fittest to reconcile us to God, and the second to give gifts to reconciled friends. Secondly, who was more fit to make us the adopted sons of God by grace, then he who was the beloved Son of God by nature? who fitter to make us beloved sons of God, then he who was the Son of his love? who fitter to repair the image of God which consisted in Righteousnesse and Holinesse, then he who was Gods essential
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:118911:67"/>image! man lost Gods image, and the image of God takes up mans image; man cannot conform himself unto God, the Son of God conforms himself to man, and this seems to be most agreeable to that sinne, which was the first motive of the Incarnation, it was a sin against the Wisdome of God, our first Parents affected to be like God; by eating the forbidden fruit, and God descending from heaven ironically upbraids him, <hi>Behold the man is like one of us.</hi> 1. Like the Son of God. and by Incarnation we may also say, behold, God is as one of us. Lastly, who was more meet to be a Mediatour of reconciliation, then the middle Person of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Trinity, who was the Mediatour of union, as Divines do speak in the state of Creation, and before the fall of <hi>Adam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus far proceeded touching the necessity of a Saviour, and that the Son of God was designed to the office of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour. I am not to shew that he took to himself our flesh, and by Incarnation made it our flesh, and by this means he had of his own, though from us, what to offer unto God for us: the manner of this divine mystery, no man is able to conceive fully, much lesse to expresse perfectly, God tries our faith by those things wherein our capacities are not strong, that is an object of our faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the humane nature is united personally to the Son of God, and to make this as plain as I am able, I do conceive it is the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est way to illustrate it negatively, first, to shew what it is not, and then we shall the better conceive what it is.</p>
                  <p>First of all, the two natures united, do not constitute a third out of them, as is done when there is no repugnancy, but mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all dependence as in the Union of the soul and body which makes a man, but this Union whereof I speak, is not the constitution of a third nature out of the parts united; for then that properly would be neither God nor man, as a man so constituted of soul and body, is neither soul nor body; the infinite person subsisting from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is not changed by the humane nature, which was in time united to it, this is illustrated by a humane person, which subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath in time teeth in the mouth, the man ceaseth not to be a person, nor is he changed into another person, nor doth he thereby grow up to a third, which is neither man nor teeth, and to speak properly there is not a composition, but as Divines do speak, <hi>quasi compositum,</hi> the person of Christ is not but in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry generall sense, a compound person, and the reason is, because
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:118911:67"/>a <hi>Compositum</hi> is more perfect then the parts which do compound it, but nothing can be more perfect then the divine person; nothing can be added to it, which had from Eternity all the perfection of the humanity in a more eminent manner, then it is in it self.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, God did not take upon him the person of man, but the nature of man, Christ is not divided into two persons, <hi>viz.</hi> the Person of the Son of God, and the Person of the Son of man, as <hi>Nestorius</hi> the Heretick held, that he was a Person begotten of God before all worlds, and a Person born of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> in our flesh, its true, the Essentiall parts of a mans body and soul be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united, would have constituted a person, as they do in all other men, if they had been left to themselves, it was prevented and stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from subsisting in it self, and was drawn into the Unity of the second person by divine and supernatural operation, whereby it was highly advanced, and subsists in a more eminent sort then it could have done if it had bacome a rational humane person. The ground of the errour of <hi>Nestorius</hi> was this, he took not heed to the first beginning of that admirable combination of God with man: the Son of God did not take to himself a man then existing and perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but the humane nature and conjunction with Gods Son, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan both at one instant: his making and taking our flesh was but one act; the Son of God did not assume a mans person to his own, but a mans nature to his own person; he did not advance any one person amongst men above all others, but wisdome hath built her house of that nature which is common to all men, she made not this or that man her habitation, but dwelt in us.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, as <hi>Nestorius</hi> believed well, that God and man are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct natures, but erred in that he denyed they were one person, so <hi>Eutyches</hi> did orthodoxically believe, that the two natures were united in one person, yet became unsound by denying the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, which still continueth betwixt the natures: this conjunction abolisheth not, nor confoundeth the natural properties, but from the first combination, they have been, are, and shall be for ever inseparable; when his soul forsook the Tabernacle of his body, his Deity forsook neither body nor soul; the principall ground, which misled both these Hereticks, was one and the same; every nature, and perfect rational subsistence is a person, but Christ was perfect God and perfect man, therefore, both of them were Persons: So <hi>Nestorius,</hi> but <hi>Eutyches</hi> reason thus, in
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:118911:68"/>Christ there is but one person, therefore after Union, there is but one nature, of the different sorts of these <hi>Eutychians,</hi> both an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, and in the latter dayes: See <hi>Zanchius de incarnat. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, the Union of the two Natures in Christ is not in the Substantiall indistance of these, for God is every where present, and if it consisted in this, not onely the humane nature. but the most abject creature would be truly assumed into the person of the Son of God, nor is it simply in conferring admirable gifts and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, for then holy men and holy Angels, should be thus united to the Son of God, which is not to be admitted.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, neither the Divine Nature simply considered, nor as three divine persons subsist in it, is incarnated, for then the whole Trinity (which is not done) should take our nature, but as the divine nature is in the Son of God, as by his property he is distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the first and third person, in Christ there is but one personall subsistence, and that was from Everlasting, and by his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the nature of man, he still continueth one person, and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth but the manner of his subsisting, which was before in the meere glory of the Son of God, and is now in the verity of our flesh Now whether this by a proper appellation, be called an influx, or <hi>illapsus arcanus</hi> of the personality of the Word, or any other singular operation of the Deity, by which the humane nature of Christ, is, as it were, most intimately drawn to the person of the Son of God, or an extraordinary dispensation, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth it, or whether it cannot be expressed by a certain name, as some Schoolmen, 'tis not much materiall, but the manner here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is, <hi>mirabiliter singularis, &amp; singulariter mirabilis,</hi> and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scends the capacity both of men and Angels, saith learned <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To illustrate in some sort this great mystery, both ancient and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Divines have used diverse similitudes, which are very imperfect, and not able to the life to express this Union, as that of a fiery sword, which doth both cut and burn, it cuts simply in regard of the sharpnesse of the mettal, but it burns as it is fiery: two acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons here are produced from two natures, which are to be distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished, yet there is but one sword, another, as the body and soul of man do make one man, so the Divine and humane nature do make one Christ, or this mystery may be compared to one man, which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:118911:68"/>hath two accidental forms, as to be a Lawyer and a Physician, one may say, this Lawyer is a Physician, and this Physician is a Lawyer, or the humane nature of Christ is like to Missletow, which hath no subsistence of its own, to be by it self, but alwayes in a Tree, yet herein the comparison fails, that such is the weaknesse of the Plant, that it cannot subsist by it self, no more then a mans arm can live out of a humane body; that Resemblance which is most fit and cometh nearest the matter, to shadow out this Personall Union of the nature of God and of man in one Person, is of a Tree. Suppose an Apple Tree grow up, into which the branch of another Tree is engrafted, which makes not the Tree to be of a compound or middle nature, but causing the branch, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing set into the ground, might have proved an entire Tree of it self to pertain to the Unity of the Tree into which it is implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet retains its own nature, and bears its own fruit, and as you may truly say, this Harvy Tree is a Pippin Tree, and this Pippin Tree is a Harvy Tree, and consequently this Harvy Tree beareth Pippins, and this Pippin Tree brings forth Harvies, so may we say of the Person of Christ, consisting of the natures of God and man: The Son of God, who was a compleat and perfect Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son hath added to it the humane nature in the Unity of the same Person; as the Divine Nature of our Saviour, notwithstanding the Personall Union is not capable of any humane imperfections, no more is the humane nature, (in that respect a finite creature) capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be of any divine and infinite perfection; the weaknesse and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of man was not swallowed up in the Majesty of God, nor was Gods Majesty in the least diminished really by the assumption of man; the Union of the word, in regard of the persons subsistence gratiously bestowed on the humane nature, is not finite, nor the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature infinite, and as the fore-named Tree is but one, and yet hath two different natures in it, and beareth two kinds of fruits, so the holy Son of God is but one person, &amp; yet hath two different natures, &amp; by them performeth the distinct operations pertainining to either of them, and as we say, this Pippin Tree is a Harvy Tree, so doth Scriptures teach us to say, the Son. of God is the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> and this Son of <hi>Mary</hi> is the Son of God, so that both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures remain in Christ with their distinct properties; this Union addes perfection to the weak, to the humane nature, but to the nobler part the divine nature accrues no alteration at all, there
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:118911:69"/>being nothing more naturall to God, then not to be subject to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny change, 'tis set down as a rule or Principle (saith our learned <hi>Hooker</hi> in his 5.6. of <hi>Eccl. Pol.</hi>) so necessary, as nothing more to the plain deciding of all doubts and questions about the Union of both natures in Christ that of both natures there is a co-operation often, an association alwayes, but never any mutuall participation, whereby the properties of the one, are infused into the other.</p>
                  <p>From this greatest honour and highest grace that could be vouchsafed to humane nature, that it should be united to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the onely begotten Son of God, whereby this creature is exalted above all creatures, and hath all creatures under it: can we conceive that sithence God hath made the manhood his own inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable habitation, that the parts of our Nature, the soul and body of Christ, received no influences of Deity, no abilities of operation, no vertue or qualities above nature? no doubt but it had from the grace of U<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The second Effect or Consequent of this personall Union is not as the <hi>Lutherans</hi> say, <hi>Kemnitius, Brackman, Gerhard, Cramerus,</hi> and others, a communication of the Divine properties to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, so that it should be truly omnipotent and omnipresent, not to insist on the Confutation of this Heterodoxe at present, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance shall suffice to shew the contrary: the hand of man is joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with mans immortall soul, and informed, quickned and acted by it, will it thence follow, that wheresoever the sense is present, there the hand must be? verily no, the soul is in the foot, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:118911:69"/>in other parts of the body, where every one sees the hand is not, if this be not the effect of personall Union, what is it then? it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the communication of the properties to the person, and that is, When the properties of either nature considered singly, and apart are attributed to the person, from which soever nature it be denominated; to understand this the better, we are to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of abstract and concrete terms, as Divines do call them, an abstract word denotes the nature simply, as deitie, humanity: a Concrete term imports the person that hath the same nature, <hi>viz.</hi> God, man; we cannot truly say, the Deity is the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, or the humanity is the Deity, or the Deity is man, or the humanity is God in the Concrete; nor thus the humanity is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, the Deity is created, the Deity is passible, the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is impassible, nor that the humanity is every where, and the Divinity limited to a certain place, but we may say, God is man and man is God; God suffered death, as well as he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the dead from their graves; the Son of <hi>Mary</hi> created the world, we cannot properly say, that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> bore, or the <hi>Baptist</hi> did Baptize, or <hi>Pilate</hi> did Condemne, or the Jewes Crucified the nature of Man, because all these are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall Attributes, his person is the Subject of all these, and it is but one Subsistence, his Nature is that which makes his person capable to receive, so that of Necessity we must ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that to the Person of the Sonne of God, which was spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Christ according to his Humane Nature, that he was according to the Flesh Born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed of <hi>John</hi> in the River of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and judged by <hi>Pilate</hi> to dye and put to death by the Jews, because there is but one Personal Divine Subsistence, so that no Person was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but the Sonne of God, no Person was baptized, accused, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned and crucified, but the Son of God; all such Actions and Passions agree to the Person really; though sometimes in respect of one Nature, sometimes in respect of the other: when we say, God is Man, we mean, that two Natures meet in one Person, and man is God for the same Reason: And therefore this Mutuall Conversive Predication is not properly called Communication of properties, nor are they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, but unusuall and reciprocall, but when the Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the humane nature, are attributed to the person denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:118911:70"/>from the divine nature, these are called crosse and circulatorie speeches, by reason of association of natures in one subject, 'tis said, the Jews crucified the Lord of glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. we must needs understand the whole person of Christ, who being Lord of glory, was crucified, but not in that nature, for which he is called Lord of glory, so is it said, that the Son of man came down from heaven, even the Son of man, which (being on earth) is in heaven, <hi>John</hi> 3.13. at the same instant. The Son of man is taken for the whole person of Christ, who being man on earth filled heaven with his glorious presence, but nor according to that nature for which he is called man, so that in these speeches there is mutuall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and the concrete names, God and man, do take inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeably one anothers room and place; this communication of the properties is reall in respect of the person, not verbal, and though the properties of either nature do really belong to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine person, yet are they not, as I said, really communicated to the other nature, but each nature retains its native qualities: Thus the Deity is infinite and the Humanity is finite, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect all things in Christ, excepting his person, are double, there are two natures, two wills, which are the cause and grounds of different operations, and therefore albeit there is in the Trinity, <hi>alius &amp; alius,</hi> yet is there not <hi>aliud &amp; aliud,</hi> there is diversity of persons, but not of natures, but it is far otherwise in Christ, for there is not <hi>alius &amp; alius,</hi> that is, two persons, yet is there <hi>aliud, &amp; aliud,</hi> diversity of natures, and hence it is, that the properties are affirmed of the person, albeit the denomination is from the other nature, and then to prevent scandall, and occasion of error, we are to adde such an explication, as this is, this speech is verified of Christ according to the other nature, thus for example, when we say, Christ the Son of God is a creature, we adde in regard of his humane nature, much more might be added, but this which I have premised, is the principall to clear up truths, and to confute the Adversary, because I do observe, that he is led into pernicious errours, and draws unsound Collections from the word of God for want of understanding of the premises, because what is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the person of Christ in reference to one part, he takes it usually as spoken of our Saviour in all his parts, and thence dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth his Arguments to the deluding of himself, and others, if I should thus argue a man is mortall, subject to be annoyed by
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:118911:70"/>heat, cold; and therefore the soul of man is mortall and subject to such hurtfull passions. Will not every intelligent Reader discern the fallacy? I shall now by the help of God, tread in the steps of my Adversary, and returne a punctuall answer to his writing.</p>

                  <p>That Christ is the Son of God, who doubts? The Socinians fall short of truth, and do not speak so highly of his glorious Sonship as we do, for we maintain he was so the Son of God, that we do believe he alwayes was Gods Son, and of the same infinite nature with his heavenly Father, and that he cannot as he was man, be called the adopted Son of God, because to be a Son, is a personall property; persons and not natures are born, and the humane nature being assumed into the Unity of the person (as it were) a part of it, the whole Person, that is Christ in both na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, is called the naturall Son of God; for so saith the Text, <hi>He shall be called, i.e.</hi> declared, manifested, and professed to be the Son of the most High, not the natural Son of the most high, by vertue of the Holy Ghost, for then the Holy Ghost should have been his natural Father, and the humane nature should have been Divine, because that which is begotten is produced out of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of him that doth beget.</p>
                  <p>As for that Title most High, it is attributed to God. Either in respect of place. 1. Because God dwelleth in the highest heavens, which are above all created Substance. 2.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:118911:71"/>of his Person, because both divinely inspired Scriptures, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son sets him forth most truly, to be a person above all created sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistences, he being independent, and they all of them depending on him. 4.

I do observe that the Adversary would obtrude upon this usuall fallacy, <hi>à dicto secundum quid ad dictum simpliciter,</hi> for though the Son be equall to his Father touching his Deity, and in this respect they are co-essentiall and equall in essentiall properties, as wisdome, power, equall in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, honour and glory, for he saith, <hi>the Father is in me,</hi> if the Son be lesser then the Father, how can the greater (adequably) be in the lesser, <hi>Greg. Nyss. orat. de Deitate filii &amp; Spiritus sancti,</hi> and he proves it, because the Son of God swore to <hi>Abraham</hi> by himself, because he had no greater to swear by, yet in a threefold respect, the Son may be said, to be lesser then the Father.</p>
                  <p>First, because the Father, as he is the Father, is Principle of his Sons Person, though he be not before him in nature, nor in time, nor in any Divine &amp; Essential perfection, which is called <hi>perfectio simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citer simplex seu absoluta,</hi> nor in a Relative pefection which is called <hi>perfectio in suo genere,</hi> which includes something, which belongs not to another, as the Divine persons are relatively opposed, yet with an equal perfection, yet as the Father gives &amp; communicates the divine Essence to the Son, but the Father hath not his eternal Essence from the Son of God; so may he be called a Principle of his Son, greater than the Son, as a King that takes his Son to partake with him
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:118911:72"/>in an equall power of governing his Kingdome is greater than his Son, as he is his Father, but equall to him, as he is a man, and as he is a King; so that when in the <hi>Athanasian</hi> Creed, 'tis said, no one in the Trinity is greater then another, 'tis meant in regard of nature and Essentiall properties, but there was no meaning to take away the reason of the Principle of originall; for we may not think that <hi>Athanasius</hi> contradicts himself, and he himself <hi>orat.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Arianos,</hi> near the end, acknowledgeth that in this respect the Father is greater then the Son, he is God by a kind of Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency in a Rhetoricall not a Logicall or Metaphysicall sense, <hi>Bister<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> the greater number of the Greek Fathers, which were op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to the <hi>Arrians</hi> approve this Exposition: the Fathers of the <hi>Sardicane</hi> Councel <hi>Theodoret Histor. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. <hi>Basil Epistle</hi> 143 <hi>ad Caesar. &amp; lib.</hi> 1. <hi>advers.

Object.</hi> 3. before the second which shall be mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The second which is more easie to be understood, and preferred before the other by <hi>Chrysost.</hi> and <hi>Theophilact in loc.</hi> and generally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the Orthodox, is this, the Son is lesse then the Father, in respect of the humane nature which was assumed, not into the unity of the person of the Father, but of the son of God, in this respect, the Father is simply greater than the son, for he is the Eternal son of God and Creatour of the humanity, nor is he in this Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion onely lesse than the Father, but the Holy Ghost is greater and in order before him, yea further, in this respect is he lesse then himself, as God, he is both lesse and greater than himself, a servant and a Lord, subject, and not subject to himself, and this with great reason, because there is but one person, and these different attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions pertained to him in regard of the different natures, and I adde that he was made for a short time <hi>lower than the Angels,</hi> Heb. 2. in regard of his sufferings; these words objected in saint <hi>John</hi> were spoken by Christ, as he was the son of man, and not simply as he was the son of God; the truth her of appears by the light of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent words, <hi>I go to the Father,</hi> in this respect the Father is greater than I am, for as he was the son of God, he was always with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to confirm this Exposition, it is no where said in all the Scripture, if I mistake not, that the Holy Ghost is lesse than the first Person of the Holy Trinity.</p>
                  <pb n="123" facs="tcp:118911:72"/>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Father may be said to be greater than the son, not simply as he was God, nor as he was the naturall son of God by eternal generation, for so they are equall, but in regard of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Mediatour; the humane nature is the foundation of this manner of speaking. I am my Fathers Ambassadour, and I go to my Father, as he is sent of the Father, he that sends, as such is ordinarily greater than he that is sent, the Son of God by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine dispensation became the son of man, died for us, sits at the right hand of God, and is exalted by the Father to the highest ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, far above all Principalities and Powers; in a word, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater than the Son, if not in regard of his Divine natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Was it never heard, that a man hath underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to be a Mediatour to another man? and must this man of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity, because he may be said to be inferiour to another in regard of this friendy office, be inferiour also in regard of his nature and place?</p>

The Adversary doth here im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly deny, and it is his corrupt Judgement, that God is not on Earth, but the holy Scriptures have taught us to have more honourable apprehension of the infinite God, <hi>Psalm</hi> 139.7. where the presence of Gods Essence is clearly asserted to be in places, which are most unlikely, if there were any such, that God be absent from them, as Hell, and the extreamest parts of the Sea, yet God is present there, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.23. all things are known to God. <hi>Am I saith the Lord, a God at hand, and not a God afar off?</hi> So <hi>Isa.</hi> 66.1. he is substantially present, as well to his Footstool, as to his Throne, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.27, 28. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 4.6. its a safe Rule to take Scriptures properly, unlesse manifest necessity enforceth to take them Tropically, <hi>Augustine de Doctrina Christiana, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.16. how else should God be infinite?

For the transient Actions of Spirituall Substances require the presence of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents; nor is God onely in the World, but without it also, for the World it self is finite, and Gods Essence if it were inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the World, could not be infinite, hence wise <hi>Salomon</hi> saith 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 8.27. <hi>That the Heaven of Heavens contains him not,</hi> the highest Heavens do not limit him, he is higher than the Heavens, the Truth is, he is in all imaginary spaces, and nowhere in that respect now, where he was not from Eternity; this Atheisticall Heresie is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by Fathers, Schoolmen, <hi>Tomb.</hi> 1. <hi>Senten.

                  <p>The holy Apostle, 2 <hi>Phil</hi> 6.7. sets down in a few words very much what we are to believe touching the Son of God before his Incarnation.</p>
                  <p>First, That he was a person before the assumption of our flesh, for there was a time, so I must speak, when he had not assumed our flesh.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, because holy Angels are compleat rational substances, and therefore Persons, to shew evidently, that he is not in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of created Angels, he tells us, that he was in the Form of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, because the Father is God, and a divine Person by way of distinction from him; it is said, he was in the Form of God, the Essentiall image of his Father.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, because there are many which are called gods, which are not so by nature, but in the opinion of Idolaters onely, or by grace and favour, as Angels, Kings and Princes, therefore it is said he was God, and thought it no prey or injury to be so, as Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and <hi>Adam</hi> would have made a prey of the Divinity, a Son assumed by the Father to the Government of the Kingdome, holds it not as a prey or robbery, for he did not forcibly take that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on him, but the Father gave it him.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, least any should think that Christ, albeit he was God by nature, yet he was inferiour to the Father, he addes that he was equall to the Father.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, against <hi>Sabellius</hi> the Apostle shews, that the Person of Christ is distinct from the Person of the Father, for otherwise he could not be equall to him, equality is alwayes betwixt two at least.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> with others, expounds not this Scripture of Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Assumption of our nature, but they contend it is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of Christ manifested in the Flesh by his miracles to be in the form of God, and albeit the <hi>Lutherans</hi> do not abhor from this sense, that he had in his humane nature divine Majesty communicated to him, which he might at pleasure most gloriously manifest, yet will not this be serviceable to the Adversary, because, as they say, this follows upon the Personall Union, and presupposeth that this man Christ Jesus was true God, which Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> denies: he saith,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:118911:74"/>he was in the form of God, for the free exercise of the Divine power, others adde in governing the world, and being worshipped, these are but consequences of the Deity, and he was God before the Creation, and when there was no Creature to worship him, and will so continue after the generall Judgement to all Eternity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Neither doth God simply rule, as God, but as Lord: God was alwayes actually God, but not alwayes actually Lord, he was not till he had Servants subject to him, for <hi>Dominus &amp; servus sunt relata &amp; simul natura.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. If that be the form of God, then Christ was seldome in the form of God: What exteriour form of God could the Wise men see in Jesus when he lay in the Manger? and others when he was poor, <hi>and had not a house to lay his head in? as a worm and no man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. And if this be the meaning, then were the Apostles in the Form of God, though in an inferiour degree, and <hi>gradus non mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat essentiam,</hi> for they had the gift of working miracles.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, nothing in all the world is said to subsist in its actions, but Christ should subsist in actions, if they were the Form of God.</p>
                  <p>The Adversary asserts a monstrous piece of Divinity, that the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power was communicated to a Creature; this must needs be then either when he began to be a Creature, what needed he then have any created gifts above men and Angels? is not the light of a Candle superfluous, when we have the light of the bright Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shine? 1. Besides, suppose this divine power was given to Christ at any time, this divine Power is either the same infinite Power which is in God, or diverse from it; if the first, how can that which is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite be capable of that which is infinite? must not the Subject either by nature, or divine operation be proportionable to the Attribute? and how can the same infinite vertue be communicated to the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to the humane nature, and not the Divine nature it self, when these are in truth all one? and how can the infinite Power of God which is in him, and which he doth retain be necessary and concurre to effect that to the which the Person of God is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, nor doth concur? This is to make a divorce betwixt the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Power of the person, and the person himself, which implies a contradiction: if this Divine power be diverse from that of God, there must be granted an infinite created power, which seems to be impossible; besides, it will follow, that there are two omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:118911:75"/>and two infinite Powers, and why may not the in finite divine Nature be multiplied, as well as the infinite Power of God? and if the divine Nature is multiplied, there are more Gods than one? if two Gods, why not three, four, and so <hi>in infinitum?</hi> this must be granted, or else 'tis not the divine Power which the Creature hath, but the effect thereof.</p>
                  <p>I add, is this Divine Power a substance, or an accident? if it be a substance, then are there two substances in Christ, which the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver saries deny, the one must be finite, the other infinite: besides this infinite substance being compleat and understanding, must needs be a Person, for it is not an infinite Person, if it doth not understand and will, and exist of it self: if it be an accident, then it is not infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, for an infinite Power can create a finite subject, and that in an instant, and standeth not in need of a substance wherin it must exist, for if it was so weak that it could not subsist of it self, and preserve it self, how then can it be called an infinite Power? o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise the vertue thereof is not infinite, but finite and limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, it implies a contradiction, to say a property can exist out of its subject, if it belongs to more than one, it ceaseth to be a property, and tis a common attribute, the property of the soul cannot be derived to the body, so as to inhere in it, as the subject of it, but the operation of the soul by such a property is in the body, nor is it easie to be understood how in the same subject, in the same part of the subject there can be a finite and an infinite Power, a Power limited and unlimited: its true, that the same Person at the same time hath that power which is both finite and infinite, but 'tis in divers natures: in the Divine, the Power is infinite, in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, finite.</p>
                  <p>Again, if one property of God is communicated to a finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then are they all, for the Divine Attributes are the Divine Essence it self, his glory, his Godhead, but the humane nature is not capable of eternity, properly so called, and therefore of none of the Attributes, Against the <hi>Lutherans</hi> it is thus argued, <hi>As is the union, so is the communication:</hi> but the union is reciprocal, thus man is God, and God is man, but the Deity cannot be said to be mortal, weak, therefore the humanity cannot be said to be immortal, this cōmuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is an effect of union by emanation: we cannot say the humane nature is God, therefore we cannot say the humane Nature is Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent.
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:118911:75"/>I am not ignorant that there are distinctions which are brought to salve and qualifie the matter, which are throughly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussed by learned men: but to be short, it is ignominious to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty, that any creature should be equallized to him, and in truth to destroy the humanity of Christ who was like us in all things, sin only excepted; which could not be verified of him, if the Divine properties belonged to the humane Nature of our Saviour, to say the Divine properties are communicated to the humane, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally, essentially, and subjectively, but <hi>per</hi>

                  <p>There are two things touching Christ, which are distinguished in this text, the one is the exinanition of his Person in some sense, who being in the form of God, emptied himself, or made himself of no reputation, not as he is God absolutely considered, for so he is most simple, full of glory, power, Majesty: but as he is considered rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, in regard of the manifesting of himself to them for their sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; thus he lessened, and humbled himself from the condition of being Lord of all, to that of an ordinary man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Text declareth the submission of his Person thus emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied in these words: <hi>he humbled himself</hi> the Adversary makes no mention of the former, which yet in the first words is only meant, and confines the meaning of the Holy Ghost to the second: Christ emptied himself, when he who was the eternal Son of God, the true God, infinite in all perfections assumed our flesh into the unity of his Person, to be as we all are, truly, really Man, by means whereof
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:118911:76"/>he is capable of meaner offices, then were consistent with the blessed Deity: the only gain which he purchased to himself thereby, was to be capable of losse and detriment, for the benefit and salvation of sinful Men: the Lord possessor of all things conversed amongst men, as though he had nothing at all, his divinity was obscured in the humanity, not in it self, but as the brightness of the Sun is by the intervening of a thick cloud betwixt us and the body of that great light, or it was like a glass with a Candle in it dawbed over with mire, or like a sword in a sheath not yet drawn out of it: by these comparisons do our Divines labour to illustrate this high mystery. Mr. <hi>Biddles</hi> Exposition hath no savour in it, nor likelihood of truth, for who is so simple to believe that Christ emptied not himself til he was 33. years old, and then being in the form of God, yielded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be apprehended of the Officers?</p>
                  <p>Your Exposition of Christs taking on him the form of a servant to be whipt, is too short, he was indeed Gods servant, but not the servant of man, nor did he wear the ensigns of a servant to be known by, nor was he whipt as a servant, but as they counted him sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious: besides we read of the afflictions for Christ his sake, as <hi>Paul</hi> was apprehended, bound and whipped, yet is he not said to take upon him the form of a servant, yea, Princes have been wronged by their Subjects, apprehended, imprisoned, yet are they not said to take upon them the form of servants, nor is it the property of ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants willingly to be whipped as Christs was for our sakes, and if some are not deceived, <hi>Pilate</hi> scourged Jesus, <hi>John</hi> 19.1. that he might be freed from the further cruelty of the Jews.</p>
                  <p>I add, That it was no way necessary that a servant should be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, whipped: is not a servant in the form of a servant when none of these evils do befall him? or is every one that is apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded &amp; scourged by the authority of a Magistrate, a servant? servants as servants are not so handled, but as they are judged to be offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as Christ spoke, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.52. <hi>Be ye come out with swords and staves to apprehend me as a Thiefe?</hi> nor did Christ when he was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and on the crosse lay down his divine power, for when they which were sent to take him, heard him say, <hi>I am he whom ye seek,</hi> they fell backward, and then he healed the ear of <hi>Malcus</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> had cut off, and he commanded effectually, <hi>if ye seeke me, let these my Disciples go their way,</hi> and on the cross he converted the Thief: Christs suffering of himself to be apprehended, bound,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:118911:76"/>as if he could no more resist than ordinary men, are not the form of a servant, but the consequents of it, without which the form of a ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant may be continued as experience, and the name of form it self importeth.</p>
                  <p>In the old Testament the Son of God appeared often, sometimes in the likeness of a man, he spake also to <hi>Moses</hi> out of the bramble Bush, which seemed to be on a flame, and yet was not consumed: and he as a Conductor led the Israelites in the wilderness by a cloud; but he is not therefore said to <hi>make himselfe of no reputation,</hi> but then did he take upon him the form of a servant when he became man, and was in that nature <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, this is not an external, but a real form, he was really Gods servant in his humane nature, and undertook an office designed him by God, and most faithfully obeying him for our salvation. I do grant that we do not say, that perfect Man in state of innocency was in the form, of a servant, or when he shal be glorious in heaven, these words belong to Christ in the state of humiliation, as God was made Man, so was he made a servant for man, and being omnipotent, he became weak; and being immortal, he became mortal, not simply as he was in the form of God, for so is he always equall to his Father, but because he became mortal to make us im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, he took our nature, with all the natural properties thereof, and was like us in all things, sin only excepted.</p>

                  <p>The Apostle particularly explicates what he understood by the form of a servant, if any one should question what that form was? was it the form of a created Angel? or of a heavenly body? or of a new created thing? the Apostle denies all this, and tels us he was made in the likeness of man; that is, as is confessed, of ordinary and vulgar men; likeness here is not of imitation and representation, as Anabaptists do from hence collect, that he is not co-essential to us, but it is of identity and participation, as one Egg is like an Egg, and yet is an Egg in substance, and <hi>the Son is like the Father, Gen.</hi> 5.3.
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:118911:77"/>yet is he truly a man; Christ seemed not to be what he was not in truth, a man in appearance, but he was truly a man; he was like other men both in body and soul, both in essentials and accidentals, sin only excepted.</p>
                  <p>From the adjunct the subject is proved, he was made in the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of man, when in the Virgins womb he assumed our nature, and not else properly, though it is true, he was wrapped in swadling cloaths, was visible, palpable, as an Infant now is, and yet is he not said upon that account to be made in the likeness of man, and mans nature in Heaven is without hunger and thirst, and such a state wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a man is truly obnoxious to misery.</p>
                  <p>The Exposition of the next words may pass, if rightly understood: He was found, namely, by those which conversed with him, in the habite in his outward condition, no whit differing from a common man. Many of the ancient Fathers do usually compare the Son of Gods taking our flesh into his Person to a mans putting on his Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>Ambrose de fide contra Arianos cap.</hi> 8. Especially and most frequently doth <hi>Athenasius</hi> so speak, which holds truly in some things, that as we are not changed by putting on our garments, nor the garments themselves by being put on; so neither is the Son of God changed (he remains what he was) nor mans assumed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

'Tis true, there are many dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes: as, <hi>omne simile est dissimile,</hi> for the garment doth not essentially pertain to the being of man, nor can we be said to be born, &amp; not til then when we are first cloathed, nor can a man be said to be made his garments, as all these are verified of the Son of God in our nature: but suppose the Apostle alludes not to garments in this place, as I think he did not <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Now that this place doth not speak of an Incarnation, or assumption of humane Nature (as they term it) nor of such an equality as is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly conceived, is evident by all the circumstances, first the scope of the Apostle is to exhort the Philippians to humility, and that they would do nothing out of vain glory, to which purpose he sets before them the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Jesus Christ, and therefore the act of Christ which he doth exemplifie must be manifest, since examples are wont to be taken only from such things as are manifest, but to whom was or could that incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation commonly talked of be manifest, when themselves say, it passeth the understanding of Angels to comprehend it? yea, that there was any incarnation at all made, the Scripture no where expressely affirmeth, nor can it be so much as proved by any good consequence from thence, as severall learned Men have shewne.</hi>

                  <p>There is no controversie about the general scope of the words, that it is to shame the Philippians, and to exhort them to humility, and to this end he alledgeth the Example of Jesus Christ, which is an Argument <hi>a majori ad minus,</hi> the greater is his humiliation, the more convincing will his example be to move us to be humble. Here the Divinity of Christ is asserted, and that precedaneous to his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the rise whereof is much increased by this unparalleld pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of greatest condescention, and yet nevertheless the greatest manifestation of Christ his glory: never so much of the Divine power and glory was seen on the earth, as in this example which was without example, the Son of God became the Son of man, and not in the form of a glorious King, as <hi>Solomon</hi> was, but of a dispised servant,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:118911:78"/>and albeit he contracted no sinne, either by propagation or action, yet were our sinnes imputed to him, as our surety, to pay our debts, as the shadow of the Sun went backten degrees, that King <hi>Hezekiah</hi> might have a certain sign of his recovery to health and happinesse, so hath the Son of God by taking our Flesh gone back many degrees, that our sick souls might be freed from sins, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally happy.</p>
                  <p>This cannot be an example saith the Adversary, because it is not manifest, no, nor can the holy Angels comprehend it. What false and weak arguing is this? Who is so weak, that he perceives it not? It is plainly to confound those things which should be distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: it is to us manifest, that the Son of God became the Son of man, and as <hi>Bernard, Serm.</hi> 1. <hi>de Annunciat. ventu Dom.</hi> he had a Father in Heaven, and sought a Mother on Earth; this do we stedfastly believe, because it is attested by the infallible Testimony of the Holy Ghost, who is the first verity, and we know, that this <hi>Sacramentum pietatis,</hi> is not <hi>Detrimentum veritatis.</hi> 1.

Death dissolves the nature, and destroyes the person of man, but in death it self, the body and foul were inseparably united to the Son of God, and albeit there is a greatly quickning vertue in God than there is in a reasonable soul, and without the separation of the soul from the body, man cannot dye, yet follows it not, that God should be separated from the flesh, that it should dye, because the dying vertue quickens not the Creature, as the soul doth the body, <hi>viz.</hi> formally and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, but efficiently, and therefore as Christ suffered when his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power was not diminished, so did he die, when life it self was not actually separated.</p>

                  <p>The Lord was really and eternally God when he came down from heaven, and was in Majesty and all the Divine Attributes equal to the Father, for though the Father is not here expressed, nor the Son, yet both must of necessity be understood, for is not Christ the Son of God, and how can a Son be conceived without relation to his Father? besides, is there any other God (to speak <hi>ad hominem</hi>) but God the Father? if none other, than without all evasions, God the Father must needs be meant, nor can any made God take place here, for is not the Son of God above them all?
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:118911:81"/>surely he is not equal, but superiour to them, observe, how by the Adversaries confession, if it had been said, the Son is equal to the Father, the words had directly thwarted our Saviour, <hi>The Father is greater than I am:</hi> But without controversie, Christ saith, he is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to God the Father, we can readily unty the knot, and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile these seeming Contradictions by a Distinction, he is equall, as God, but unequal as man, but Mr. <hi>Biddles</hi> which denies the two natures in Christ can never do it, but he is entangled in the Briars and Thorns, and so scratched, that he knows not which way to turn him.</p>
                  <p>The Father and Son I grant are one in Essence, albeit there is a difference in their manner of having the Deity: the Son is consub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantial to his Father, according to the Deity, and consubstantiall with us men according to his Humanity, yet with this clear diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence the Son of God hath the same individual nature with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, because it is infinite and not capable of multiplication but the Humanity of Christ being finite, is not one with ours in number (for every singular man hath his own individual nature) but one as they say in kind, but your Supposition if equall, then one in Essence, is a mistake, if I have not forgotten the little Logick and skill in Metaphysicks which I had sometimes learned, for no Essence or substance, as Essence or Substance, can in that notion be equal to another.</p>
                  <p>It is congruous to say, that upon the Unity of Essence is founded identity, upon the Unity of the Divine Attributes, is founded simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude, and upon the Unity of Divine magnitude is founded equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity: magnitude in God, is not <hi>magnitudo nobis, sed perfectionis essentialis,</hi> if essential perfection: there is I grant, the same Power, Wisdome and Eternity in God the Father, and God the Son, for these do absolutely belong to God as God, in these the Father is not greater than the Son, for they are equal, equality is a property be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to quality, or as Logicians speak to the same degrees of quality; it is true, as the Schoolmen speak, that the Divine es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality doth not in the formal conception thereof include the Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, nor the Relations of originall, but it imports the Essence fundamentally, and the personal relation of originals, <hi>praeexigitive</hi> but there is a most pefect equality in the Divine Attributes, which have the consideration of greatnesse, on which equality is founded, and this greatnesse is one in number with the three Divine persons, as
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:118911:81"/>by consequence, the Unity of equality is greater in this mystery, than the Unity of equality in the creatures, because in the former it is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly numericall, but in the creatures it is specificall, there it is indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, but here it is divisible: there are three infinite eternal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and yet there are not three infinite creatures, <hi>&amp; gubernantes omnium,</hi> be cause there is but one God, but one onely Divine Essence in wisdome, power and goodnesse equall in honour and glory, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, because the Son as well as the Father hath life in himself, the Son searcheth the hearts and reins, as well as the Father, the Son quickneth whom he will, as doth the Father: the Son hath equal power with his Father, both in heaven and in earth, and reigns with the highest authority, all men and Angels are bound to worship the Son as they do the Father, if then the Father be infinite, the Son is also infinite, else should there be that proportion and equality betwixt them, as we have shewed there is.</p>

                  <p>The foundation, that is, the interpetation of this Text given by the Adversary being destroyed, how can such Inferences stand upright?</p>
                  <p>First, I say these words are neither true, for you have not yet proved, nor can prove, that the Son of God is not equal to his Father in regard of the Divine Power, nor do they agree to your own words, <hi>page</hi> 10. there you say, the Divine Power was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Christ; the Exercise then of his Power was visible I grant, but not the power it self, who sees that which is within a man, but by the effects? nor are they but short of what other Socinians hold, not limiting the form of God, to the Exercise and Demonstration of the Divine Power of working Miracles, but to extend it to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Church, and to the worship which is exhibited to him. Your Exposition is so short, that if it be true, Christ should not now be in the Form of God (which you will not avouch) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no visible Miracles are now wrought by him.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The words agree not to the Adversaries Position and Exposition of the other words, the form of a servant denotes the humane nature, with humane infirmities, and by proportion the form of God must signifie the Divine nature with Glory and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the Exercise and Demonstration thereof when he pleased.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the Adversary crosseth the words of the Article, saying, Christ in working Miracles was equal to God, for I would willingly learn of him, how the second and subordinate cause can be equal in working with the first and Supream cause? Where there is equality, there may be co-ordination, but no subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as you grant there is in working, and if they be equal in their Operations, why not in Power, Glory and Worship.</p>
                  <pb n="145" facs="tcp:118911:83"/>
                  <p>This assertion of this equality cannot be satisfied, for this power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised by Christ, was either finite, or infinite; for there is not, nor can be named a third, if you will say it was finite, I do then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that it was not equal to that which is infinite; if infinite. I then demand, how that which is finite can be so far advanced, as to be capable of that which is infinite? can you shew any probable reason for that which you boldly plead for, that any meer creature should make use of the infinite power of God when it pleaseth? is an infinite power instrumentall to man? what is this else but to make a Creature the first cause, and Gods power, which is God himself, to be subordinate to him?</p>
                  <p>To the exception of the Jews, <hi>John</hi> 5.18. they objected, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst our Saviour simply, because he wrought a miracle, but because trey in their superstitious rigor adhering to the Letter of the Law, thought he had violated the Sabbath days rest, Christ replieth to this. God my Father, whose example I do follow did not so rest on that day, but that ever since he sanctified it, he hath done works of mercy and preservation every day, and why may not I his Son do so also without reprehension? but the chiefest cause indeed why the Jews were angry with him, was, because he called God his Father; and made himself thereby, as they justly inferred, equal to him, and in the former verse he saith, <hi>My Father worketh hitherto, and I work:</hi> wherein we may note three things: first, that the work of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Son is one work, the same work is common both to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son, wrought by the same Divine power, in that he useth the present tense, <hi>doth work:</hi> this is proper to God, to whom all things are present. And thirdly, that he always wrought the fame works with his Father, he worketh hitherto at all times, the works are the same: and hence in the fourth place did the Jews in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that he made himself the natural Son of God, and equal with his Father: the Jews truly conceived this to be the meaning of Christ, though they did not believe him; but Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> is more dull then they were, and doth neither appprehend the meaning of the words so well as the Jews, nor believe them.</p>
                  <p>To your Argument I answer, that there is a prerogative of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther above a Son in humane, but not in divine generation; this Arguing is <hi>falacia non parium,</hi> tis a matching and comparing things together as equall, which are in the main unequall; for it cannot be proved, that there is in <hi>Biddles</hi> sense a prerogative in the Divine
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:118911:84"/>persons either in nature, or divine Attribute, the Father (as is not desired) is a Principle of the Son, and yet to speak properly, the Son was not beholding to his Father, for his being, as by an uncouth phrase, the Adversary speaketh, as children are to their Parents, who do voluntarily, and in time beget them, but God the Father necessarily and from his intrinsecall Principle begets and could not do otherwise but beget his Son, and therefore from all Eternity begot his Son, and therefore is he co-eternal with his Father.</p>

                  <p>The person of Christ, or whole Christ was equal to his Father, and thus, he could not really be exalted to God in regard of essentiall glory, yet in regard of the manifestation of that glory obscurd (as it were) and vailed by our flesh, as the Sun by a cloud, he may be said to be glorified by his Father, <hi>John</hi> 17.5. as Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose</hi> observeth <hi>de Fide contra Arianos cap.</hi> 8. though whole Christ was equal to the Father, yet the whole of Christ was not equal, he had a humane nature, which was truly inferiour to God, and in

                  <p>Your inference, if Christ be equal with God, and excedingly exalted by him, then he should be higher than God, who is most high, is both absurd and impious, this he seems to have learned from <hi>Paul Best,</hi> who strongly, as he soolishly thought, argued against us from our own Principles, if Christ be equal to his Father as touching his Godhead, then by the addition of the glory super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added to the humane nature, he would be higher then the highest, <hi>chapter</hi> 5. for to adde to equals makes them unequalls, I answer, this rule is good, and holds infinite things, but not when we do speak of the infinite God, for God contains eminently and vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally all created perfections, insomuch that the whole world addes nothing above Gods perfection, <hi>intensivè</hi> and whether it addes <hi>extensivè</hi> is not materiall, and I leave the decision hereof to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Schools, for as an imaginable addition of milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of years to Eternity, doth not make Eternity one jot longer than it is, so the assuming and glorifying of a created being, taken into the personall Union of an infinite being, can adde nothing in greatnesse to the invisible, and indivisible God, What is a drop of water, that falls into the Sea to make it greater than it is? and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it should imperceptibly do so, yet would it not follow, that God could be made greater than he is by the addition of any created excellency for the Sea is finite, and God is infinite, and betwixt these, two there can be no equall proportion?</p>

                  <p>The Apostle wisely prevents such erroneous conceits, and informs us in expresse forms, that he was equal to his Father, and if one should further inquire, whence this equality betwixt them should arise, he tells us, that he hath it not by violence and unjust usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, which to be sure could not possibly be attained by unjust means, as our first Parents by a proud disobedience indeavoured to be like him <hi>Gen</hi> 3.5. S. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> argues acutely, if Christ was far inferiour to God, how could he possibly snatch power, and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly raise himself to be equall with God! a man cannot by any ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine make himself equal to an holy Angel, nor can a horse, if he would attempt it, raise himself up to be equall with man, shall we commend a private mans low estate, when 'tis apparent he cannot be a King? he is then equal by nature and eternal generation, and albeit he had never been made flesh, but remained alwayes in the form of God, yet the son of God, without any unjust usurpation or robbery (which is done by them which ascribe equality of any thing with God, (as you do Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi>) which is not God) the son I say, had been equal to his Father then follow those words, but he emptied himself, <hi>viz.</hi> by being made man, to suffer and dye, to make a reconciliation betwixt God and man, for which condescenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and obedience, his Father highly exalted him, whereas had he been a meere creature, and the Father his Lord by Creation, his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling himself to death, could not have been satisfactory and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the Father, would not have been thanks worthy; his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience was onely in the humane nature, but he emptying himself to become flesh, was a voluntary condescention, full of glory, wherein the Fathers will concurred with his, to glorifie both lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and mercy towards God and man, which plainly proves that Christ did not by compulsion but voluntarily vail his glory in our flesh. for he pefectly knew his own greatnesse, and his equality with the Father, and that he might if his pleasure had been so, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it without cover, as he had formerly done in heaven, and that from all eternity, or openly shewed it to all with whom he conversed on earth, if he had pleased so to have done, but out of his surpassing Charity to man for his salvation, he as it were laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side his glory for a time of his own accord, I mean the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Besides, form is sometimes so taken for an accidental, and often for a substantial form, but never for an Action which is exterior, as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> observes, and 3. if working Miracles was to be in the form of God, then the Apostles which had the gift of working Miracles, were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in the form of God, which is never in Scripture said of them. 4. I adde Saint <hi>Chrysostomes</hi> Reasons, The form of God is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to the form of a servant in this place. Now what is the form of a servant? Is it not to converse with other men like them in an exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour form? it signifies not a work, but the nature of men, in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance like other men: 5. and it is not onely a Contradiction, but blasphemy to say, that a Creature can be equal to the Creatour, in any imaginable perfection, to say, that Gods Poweris communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, either this must be intrinsecally, so that the man Christ should be omnipotent, which is impossible, or extrinsecally, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the omnipotent God dwelleth in him, the Apostle then had spoken nothing touching the singular excellency of Christ in kind, for on this account the holy ones should be equal with God, for they are all of them the Temples of God, in which he doth dwell, we may observe that Christ is said, to be made flesh, but never to be made God,</p>
                  <p>This form of God say you, is a gift of God. I do distinguish of gifts, a gift is either accidental to him to whom it is given, as faith, knowledge, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.2, 8. faith is the gift of God I have given thee <hi>(Salomon)</hi> wisdome, or essentiall; <hi>God giveth to every seed its own body,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.38. this form of God may be called a gift actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally given in time for us, <hi>John</hi> 3.16. but not a gift in your sense, as he was in the form of God, for he was so before all time, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature being communicated to him by eternal generation. I adde, that it is against experience to think a man cannot have a gift from God, and know it to be so indeed (as in the extraordinary gift of tongues and working miracles) but he must think it to be a
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:118911:87"/>prey and not a gift of God, if he useth it not to his honour that gave it; it is true that the holy One in all miracles wrought by him, and when he manifested his Glory to his Disciples, sought not his own glory, but the glory of God; yea many gifts are held forth and held fast which are not a prey, as Eloquence, Beauty, Strength, Houses, Friends, yea, when some of them cannot be kept at some time without Gods dishonour, and that in suffering times. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, seeing, as you say, he was to lay aside his Divine Power, that he might suffer according to the Will of God, it is consequential that this gift was not equally in God and in him, but that he was in the use thereof subject to God, and would not act in this kinde in as free and uncontrouled a manner as God himselfe, which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary both to your own Exposition and the truth.</p>

                  <p>These five Texts are alledged to little advantage of the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as appears by the particulars.</p>
                  <p>To the first Text, I answer, 'tis to be observed, that 'tis not said, he made him God, which is impossible, but Lord and Christ; there is a double Lordship of Christ, the one is Eternall, as was his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence, so was his Lordship communicated to him from all Eternity: as Christ is God by nature, so is he also Lord by nature, for Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion cannot be separated from Deity, hence is he frequently called Jehovah, and the Lord God Almighty, and in this sense he was not made Lord, Secondly, the Lordship of Christ is officiall, and this Lordship belongs to him, as he is our Mediatour; he was made Lord, as he was Mediatour, this is not a necessary, but a voluntray Lordship, which sometimes was, and might have been alwayes se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the Son of God, this was assumed, and by Counsel (his Fathers and his own) and taken up in time, as the Office of a Mediatour was, and this appertains to Christ as he is God-man, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the former Lordship, is exercised by vertue of it, and it declarative of it, he was truly Lord before his Resurrection <hi>Ye call me Lord, Lord, and ye say well, for so I am, John</hi> 13.13. <hi>And he saith, all things are delivered to me of my Father, Matth.</hi> 11.27, and before his Ascension, he saith, <hi>all power is given to me, both in heaven and in earth,</hi> Mat. 28.19. and from his Nativity, he was Gods Son, and born a King, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4. <hi>John</hi> 18.37. and by his Miracles, which he wrought, his Divine Power was declared; so that by his being made Lord in that Text, is not the conferring of Lordship on him
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:118911:89"/>simply, but the more clear manifestation and execution of the Acts of his Dominion.</p>
                  <p>The Scriptures alledged, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. and that <hi>Acts</hi> 2.36. do shew, that Christ had laid down all our natural infirmities, and a Sacrifice made to offended Justice, and a ransome paid for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, he acquires <hi>novum jus Domini, &amp; novum jus Imperii,</hi> as So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraigne Power over the World, or at least the Power which he formerly had, he now fully makes use of, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which he could have demonstrated before, as appears. <hi>John</hi> 18.6. he struck down the Jews with a word as with a thunderbolt this dominion then was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto him declaratively or by way of reward, &amp; he was advanced in his humane nature to the highest degree of glory that a creature was capable of. God made this God man the Prince of the Church, that he was exalted in our nature above Angels, Principalities and Powers, for the Name above every name respects every name of creatures, and not of Christ himself, for he had a greater Name, as God-man, tobe called a Saviour, and none else could be called a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in that sense as he was called, and this Name he had, not onely as the Son of God, but as God and man, for whole Christ is our Saviour, it was then above every Name the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had, yet it was not a greater Name than Christ himself had before this time, for he was called God, and the Son of God, which are Names of Essence, and do naturally imply Lordship, this Name in the Epistle to the <hi>Philippians</hi> was given to him in time, and there is a greater belonging to him, which he had before all time, none of these quoted places do prove that Christ was onely man, and not truly God, which yet was necessarily requisite to bee done by the Adversary. Can this Writer shew, that any of ours do not acknowledge all this to be true? Christ doth at this day, sitting on the right hand of God retain the Properties of the Humane Nature, and what ever accrued to him by his Exaltation, was onely in a finite manner.</p>
                  <p>It is true, the Glory of the Son redounds to the Glory of the Father, <hi>Philippians</hi> 2.21. and that we believe in God through Iesus Christ, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.21. and Christians by believing on Christ, do not depart from the living God, but do indeed more firmly depend on the Omnipotent God, who hath rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed him from the dead, Iesus Christ cryed and said, <hi>He that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:118911:89"/>on me, believes not in me, but in him that sent me,</hi> Iohn 12.44. Where there is <hi>Antanaclysis i e.</hi> one word in the same verse is used in a different sense, if this be not granted, there is a plain Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, which is not to be admitted, believeth on me, believeth not on me, <hi>viz.</hi> onely or according to the false opinion of the Jews, who believed he was onely a man, yea, an impostour, and had no Commandement from God to teach, and by consequent they were not bound to believe in him. This Scrcipture is no Disadvantage to us, but strongly proves Christ to be God, and one in Essence with the Father, in that he saith, <hi>He that believes in the Son believes in the Father,</hi> whose Commission he had, and whose Doctrines he taught, both persons equally are the Object of a Christians faith.</p>
                  <p>To the last Scripture, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.27. <hi>To God onely wise,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, God the onely wise God, infinitely wise, the Fountain of Wisdome, and by his Son being made flesh and dying for our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Gods Wisdome is revealed to the World, if the first Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son had been meant, the Son and Holy Ghost had not been excluded, but the creatures onely, as Saint <hi>Chrysostome</hi> hath well observed; the word onely is taken, diversly, sometimes to exclude all other persons, as <hi>Elias</hi> complained, <hi>I am left alone,</hi> 1 Kings 19.14. sometimes to exclude strangers, as <hi>Balaam</hi> prophesied <hi>when the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall dwell alone,</hi> and <hi>Job</hi> 31.17. <hi>If I have eaten my morsels alone, and the Fatherless have not eaten thereof.</hi> In the former sense, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alone begets the Son, in the latter the Father alone is to be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, how is he simply alone when the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Holy Ghost, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.17. <hi>I am not alone, but the Father is with me,</hi> Iohn 16.32. and therefore the Fathers being the onely wise God, excludes not the Son, because of the identity of the same undivided Essence both of the Father and Son.</p>
                  <p>This is the most common and received answer, there is another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by learned <hi>Iunius.</hi> The Text evinceth, not that the name of God is to be taken personally, and that the Father by reason of the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iesus Christ is onely meant, for Christ in a relative oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, is considered in a twofold consideration, either according to nature or a gracious occonomie; according to nature, and so the Opposition is <hi>ad intra,</hi> as the Schoolmen speak, when the second per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son relates either to the first, the Father, or else to the third Person of the Sacred Trinity, and when so, God is taken Personally, but
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:118911:90"/>the Relation in regard of the mystery of Grace, is <hi>ad extra,</hi> when Christ hath reference to the Church, being as the head to the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, for their incorporation and preservation in the mysticall body; in this respect the person of Christ is taken singly by himself, or with his Members joyntly, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. and called Christ; so is Christ in this sense, the words run thus, that Jesus Christ, who is God in the Unity of Essence with the Father and the Holy Ghost, is the head and Saviour of his body by the dispensation of graces, and by vertue of the head the Church, gives Glory to him who is God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, working in his Members effectually, <hi>Fphes.</hi> 3.20.21.</p>
                  <p>It is confessed, that as we have all spirituall blessings from God the Father by the hand of our Mediatour, so all our returns of Prayers and Prayses to God for all, if they are acceptable, are by Jesus Christ, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. without whom none of our Sacrifices can please him, but this doth not prove, that Christ is not God, and by consequent as you say, subordinate to God, but that he is our Mediatour to God, and in that respect, as he is man, and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatour, inferiour to him, and not as he is God, for the Glory which is due to God the Father, is due also to his Son, being Authour of the grace for which he is to be honoured.</p>

                  <p>1 Cor. 15.25.28. <hi>Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the Kingdome to God, even the Father, when he shall have put down all Rule—for he must reign untill he hath put all his Enemies under his feet, and when all things shall be subdued, then shall the Son himself be subject to him, that put all things under his feet, that God may be all in all. It is here said that Christ shall reign till he hath put all enemies under his feet, which done he shall deliver up the Kingdome to God the Father, and become subject to him, but how could these things come to passe, if Christ were the most High God? certainly by so doing, Christ should cease to be the most High God, for without Controversie he to whom any one becometh subject, is higher than he that becometh subject.</hi>

                  <p>The summe of this Argument is to this effect,</p>
                  <p>He that shall give up his Kingdome, and cease to reign is not the most high God, but Christ shall do so, as the Text shews.</p>
                  <p>For answer to this, we must take notice, that God hath three Kingdomes <hi>in specie,</hi> over mankind, whereof the two first are in
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:118911:90"/>earth, and the third in heaven (though they may in regard of the same Soveraign and Subjects be called one) these are grounded on a threefold right of propriety and government, Gods creating re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming, and glorifying us, the first is naturall and essentiall, and the other is according to the voluntary dispensation of grace, the first belongs to the whole Deity, in which Kingdome the three sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Persons do rule with equal power, Majesty and Glory, in the Unity of Essence, in all things and above all things unchangeably for ever and ever, in this sense there is no end of his Kingdome, for as the ruling of God the Son doth not exclude the Father from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the world and the Church: so the giving up the Kingdome into the hands of God, doth not absolutely exclude him in other respects to reign for ever. Some Divines do make another Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or explication of Gods Kingdome over Mankind by right of Creation, and that was over perfect man, which Kingdome is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver called the Kingdome of the Son or redeemer, or Mediatour, this endured but till the fall of man, <hi>Baxter</hi> against <hi>Crandon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The second Kingdome is the Kingdome of the Son or Redeemer, distinguished from the other by the foundation of right, <hi>viz.</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by it Ends, Laws and State of the Subjects, this is called by Divines <hi>oeconomium, vicarium, dispensativum regnum,</hi> for by such phrases is this Kingdome of grace usually expressed: this Kingdome is temporarie, and belongs not to Christ, as he is God, but as he is one Mediatour by a voluntary condescension. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaks expreslly of this latter Kingdome and not of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; he that had from the beginning reigned with equall power and glory with his Father, did voluntarily humble himself (yet preserving the natural right of his Dominion over all things) to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect mans care and recovery, and to bring the lapsed disobedient Creature to a conformity and obedience to God again, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Saints, our blessed Saviour and head doth now govern, as he useth his power to call the elect effectually, &amp; to protect his Church in the midst of hisenemies, &amp; at last to exalt them to a glorious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; this Monarchy of Christ can never totally be subdued, as ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Monarchies are, and have been from time to time, and other new Lords have sate on Thrones and ruled them, neither force nor fraud, nor the gates of hell can possibly prevail over the Church; this rule and Dominion our Mediatour hath received from God, and doth most holily govern at his commands, and shall continue to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:118911:91"/>Govern till hee hath put all his Enemies, the Devil and his Angels, all the wicked of the World, sin and death under his feet, and having compleated this blessed work, he delivers up the Kingdome, as having no longer any enemies to disturb these hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Subjects, this is not unlike to the fact of a King, who sends his Son with Authority and Commission to protect his good Subjects against impious Rebels that molested them; this Son when he hath by Gods blessing quelled and conquered them, and settled his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers people in a quiet and secure habitation, returns triumphant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his Father, and resigns up that powerfull Commission, which he had vested him withal. The Case is not unlike in this great work of mans Redemption, and when our Saviour at the end of the World resignes this Kingdome he doth not simply cease to govern to all Eternity, as the Father at this present rules by his Son, so shall the Son for ever rule with his Father; this resigning then, is not meant in respect of the Divine Nature, for in this respect the Son of God is equal with his Father, nor is it understood of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature of Christ, for that hath been, is now, and shall be alwayes subject to the Father, but this is meant of Christ, as he is our Mediatour: this way of government, when all enemies are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and all the Saints glorified, will be uselesse, he will then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly resign it into the hands of his Father, from whom in time he received it. In a word, to close up this Section, Christ was alwayes and ever will be the most high God, although he shall not alwayes reign in such a manner, and by such means as now he doth.</p>

                  <p>Whereas the Adversary saith; the best part of Christ is subject to God, this should have been proved, which is both fallaciously

Will any reasonable man allow these consequences? and will not every one plainly perceive, the weaknesse of the Adversaries disputing by these few Instances? Have you never heard, that by reason of the Union of two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in one Person of Christ, how that is ascribed to the Person from a Denomination, which is peculiar to one Nature onely? as that which is finite, and not to the other which is infinite? Well then, when Christ shall cease to rule in the Elect, as our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, in which respect he is inferiour and subordinate to the Father, and as man he is a part of the Church, though he is the head and most eminent part thereof, even as the first <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> was both a Root of Mankind and a Part thereof, in this respect I say, shall God deal immediately with him, as with the whole Body of the blessed ones, which shall have immediate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse to his Majesty, and without a Mediatour partake of his Glory, and Happinesse, then shall our Union with God be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate, yet so, that the Glory and Praise thereof, shall be for ever peculiar to Christ, who was the sole Procurer, and all-sufficient Purchaser of this our happy Union with the Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Trinity.</p>

                  <p>That our blessed Saviour was true man, we to our great comfort
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:118911:96"/>do acknowledge, but that he is onely man, it hath been hitherto our businesse, and shall be in that which follows to disprove; the deniall of his Deity hath a malignant influence upon the holy Gospel of Jesus Christ, and overthrows where it is embraced, the unshaken Foundation of our dearly purchased Redemption: our great Adversary Sathan, knows full well where the greatest strength of Christians lies, Who then can marvel, if he to the utmost im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves his skill, and as much as is possible to take away the lowest foundation and corner stone, that our precious faith, and hope built on him might fall to the ground? Yea, and we do further open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly professe that the son of God deigning to become man for our salvation, and Eternal God is a greater incouragement, both to Piety and Humility, than if he had been onely man.</p>
                  <p>Whereas you say, Christ in this nature is a person, that is, a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance which subsisteth of it self without the subsistence of the Son of God communicated to him, this Nestorian Heresie we do with the Church of God detest, the Nature of man, although it be a <hi>totum essentiale</hi> most perfect in regard of Essence, yet it is not <hi>totum personale,</hi> and as they speak <hi>suppositale,</hi> nor doth it act as <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium quod, sed ut Principium quo,</hi> because it wants the proper, personal subsistence, and is a part to be perfected by another part, the Deity, the humane nature indeed is <hi>substantia prima,</hi> the first substance, as it is called, and an understanding being, yet because it is not a substance compleatly incommunicable, <hi>ac ultimo subsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stens,</hi> it is not a person, as it follows not, a mans hand is a living substantial body, therefore it is a person, or the reasonable soul joyned to the Body, is a living and understanding substance, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is a person, it is such a <hi>totum,</hi> as is a part of another <hi>totum,</hi> and therefore no person.</p>
                  <p>That the Son of God took the nature and not the person of man is thus proved. First, because if the nature of man had subsisted by it self, before it had been assumed into the unity of the person of Gods Son, if it had been conceived out of the person of the son of God, then that word could not have been made flesh, as Saint <hi>John</hi> saith it was, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. Nor secondly, could it be truly said, according to the Articles of our faith, that the son of God was conceived by the Holy Ghost, besides, if the Son of God had assumed the person of man, the Son of God would be two persons, the one created and the other uncreated, but it is impossible for one
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:118911:97"/>and the same Son to be two persons, if the humane nature had been a person, it would follow in the fourth place, that the word could not be truly called man; for one person cannot be another, nor predicated of another, <hi>Peter</hi> is not <hi>Paul,</hi> but this eternal word is man, and truly called man, and in the fifth place upon this account, it is also that the Properties of the humane nature, as for example, to be born to die, to be buried, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are attributed to the person. God is born, God shed his blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and so on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Properties of the divine Nature are ascribed to the man Christ, as to quicken the dead, and to give eternal life, which could not be truly verified, if there were two distinct persons, if the same person was not both God and man.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, they could not be one Lord, if one of the persons was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the other uncreated, one of the persons finite, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infinite, but he is one Lord, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.6. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.4. nay one and the self same Lord to descend down from heaven, and to ascend up to heaven, to have the form of God, and at the same time the form of a servant, to be God blessed for ever, and to be of the Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the flesh <hi>Ephes</hi> 4.10. <hi>Rom</hi> 95. and therefore the Son of God assuming the Nature of man, did not take the person of a man, and consequently he is onely one person, and not two, these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments are strong against the Nestorians, and they do also, being taken out of Scriptures, confute Mr. <hi>Biddle,</hi> in saying the Lord Christ hath onely the Nature of man, and that this is a person; he is a true man, albeit he is not a humane person, for a man is not a a man by his personality, but by his humane nature, for by it be is formally a man: as a man is wise by wisdome, so a man is a man by his humane nature, and God by his Deity, materially I grant when we speak of other men, the humane nature doth denote a person, or that which hath the humane nature.</p>
                  <p>The Adversary addes, that none but a humane person can be our brother, this is denied, and cannot be proved, for Christ having the same specificall, albeit not the same numerical nature with us, being conceived and born with our natural infirmities, hath learned out of his experience of sorrows to be a mercifull High Priest, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. and to take pity upon us in our miseries, had his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture been exempted from the condition and properties of other men touching natural infirmities, something I confesse had been spoken, but not enough, for they that have one Father, are brethren
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:118911:97"/>Angels, which have not a humane person are the Sons of God, <hi>Job</hi> 38, 67. and so in that respect are brethren, but to wave that, sithence as Scriptures hold forth to us, that Christ was not free in the dayes of his flesh being in the World, from infirmities, which are natural: Your Argument comes to nothing; nor was it any disparagement to the humane nature, to be so prevented, as it was from being a person of, and by it self, as is the singular nature of all other men, but a higher honour to be assumed to the person of the Son of God, where it is more eminently then humane nature can be in a humane person, as it is for the vegetative and sensitive faculties to be in the soul of man, though not the forms of man, as they are of Plants and Animals.</p>

As we may not conclude, the word man is put for Christ onely, therefore he is onely man, no more can we justly infer. God is here put onely for the Father, therefore he onely is God.</p>
                  <p>I will recite <hi>Bisterfields</hi> sense against <hi>Crellius,</hi> which he borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from no others, but out of his own observation, and he tells us that the naturall order of the words are inverted, and thus to be placed, the man Christ Jesus is one God, and one Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, the man Christ Jesus is as the subject of this Proposition, and to be one God and one Mediatour, a copulative consequent thereof, as <hi>Zach</hi> 14.9. if this be the sense of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, the Deity of our Saviour is directly confirmed by it, this I onely name, let the impartiall Reader judge.</p>
                  <p>As there is one God, so saith the Text, there is one Mediatour, and this one Mediatour and Peace-maker, is opposed to all Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours, which are barely and nakedly creatures.</p>
                  <p>This holy Scripture, as the rest recited by you, proveth that Christ is a man, but it proves not, which is the Controversie, that he is onely man. The Office of a Mediatour is to reconcile parties that are at variance, and is commonly called a Mediatour of Redemption, or to unite them in a league of friendship, which formerly had not friendly entercourse amongst themselves. In this gracious Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, both extremes do happily meet in the same person: the word which was one with God by ineffable Unity, became one with man by admirable Union; this truth doth the holy Word of God teach, this doth the Church of God believe, and this do we before God and the world religiously professe.</p>
                  <p>The order of the Apostles words are to be observed, he saith the man Christ, not Christ the man; there is a difference betwixt these two, when (man) precedes, and Christ is added thereto by way of limitation, he sheweth of what man he meaneth, <hi>homo Christus</hi> notes the Person of Christ, and we may truly affirm such Proposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as these to be true, the man Christ is omnipotent, the man Christ is every where present, though the humane Nature be not omniscient, omnipotent, and every where, but whatsoever Christ hath in that created Nature is finite, and he is circumscribed in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:118911:98"/>place as he is man; the reason of this difference is because the concrete word denotes the Person, though so denominated from the abstract, I mean the humane nature: but you may not say, Christ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man is every where essentially present, for that is all one, as to say, Christ as he is a man is every where.</p>
                  <p>Nor can we Logically infer as the Pontificians do, that Christ who is God, is our Mediatour onely in the humane nature, I will not digresse and enter the Lists with those Adversaries at this time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever both by them and us it is not doubted, that this Person where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we speak, is both God and man, that he might be able to save us to the uttermost, that he might satisfie Gods Justice, appease his wrath, take away the sinnes of his people, pull down the Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Devil, and the power of death, that he might restore Gods image in us, conser and preserve our graces, and bring us to glory; these great evils could not be removed, nor could those great mercies have been bestowed on us, unlesse he had been both God and man.</p>
                  <p>This place then makes nothing for the Adversary, but if it be well observed, it makes much against him, because it is said, he is the Mediatour betwixt God and man. What shall we say onely of those that lived since his Incarnation? no verily, Christ is like the Sun in the Firmament, which casteth beams and Influences; as well backward as forward, he is a Mediatour for man, implying that he was not onely a Mediatour for men that lived since his Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, but that all the Elect from <hi>Adam</hi> till that joyfull time were reconciled to God by him, for of necessity it must follow, that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther these happy ones had no Mediatour which lived and died be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Nativity, which is a grosse errour, contrary to Gods Word, for all of them were saved by believing on the promised seed, which was to come, who was the Lamb slain from the beginning of the World, and was alwayes the same, yesterday, to day, and for ever, or else Christ was their Mediatour transacting the affairs of his people by vertue of his future Incarnation, and meritorious passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which he could not possibly have done, if he had not been God, a divine person, <hi>Non entis nullae sunt operationes.</hi> Those saithfull ones, <hi>eundem habuerunt Christum in persona, non in carne assumpta,</hi> they and we had the same Christ in regard of his person, Deity, and Humanity, though not after the same manner, the faithfull which lived before his Conception firmly believed, that he should
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:118911:99"/>come in our flesh, we in these latter times do believe that he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready come, that he hath perfectly done and suffered whatsoever was requisite for our salvation.</p>
                  <p>I may further adde, which is observed by others, that man is mentioned not to exclude the Deity, but because the Apostle is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted with the elegancy of speech, for having told us in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer verse, that God would have all men to be saved, he addes, there is one Mediatour, betwixt God and man, the man Jesus Christ, or which is another reason, because he was presently to treat of his passion, he gave himself a Ransome for us, that we men in regard he was man, might have strong consolation, and by him go boldly to the Throne of Grace in this act of Mediation, the Natures of Christ are not seperated, but yet they are distinguished, none can be a Mediatour according to substance, that is not a Mediatour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to operation, nor can any be a Mediatour according to operation, who is not a Mediatour also according to substance, <hi>Camier Paustral de officio Mediatoris, lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 5.</p>

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:118911:100"/>was, otherwise there will be a contradiction, for how could he still be in heaven when he descended thence? could he be both in heaven and earth at the same time? To this we can readily and easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answer, and make it appeare that there is no contradiction at all in these words, nor any necessity why the Adversary should cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Text with a false and unheard of Translation; marke then Christ speaking to <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> saith that he at that time was in heaven, <hi>viz</hi> as he was God, and to shew the Divine relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Father and the Son in the unity of the same Essence, and the ineffable communication of the Father to his Son, especially in his dealing towards the Elect, be <hi>viz.</hi> Gods Son manifested his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence on earth by assuming our flesh, and even then he being the true God ceased not to be in heavn, albeit he was not included ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in heaven or in earth, but within these, and without them too. The Son of man descended not from heaven as he was the son of man, that is, in regard of his humane nature, for then it would follow, which implies a real contradiction that he was a man before he was a man, a man in heaven before he was a man in earth.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it a contradiction to say the same person is at the same time both in heaven and earth, this is verified of God alwayes; and to speak to the matter in hand, in reserence to Christ, it is a received rule in contradictions, that they are to be vnderstood in the same respect; marke then the words. The Text saith not that our Lord, as he is the son of man descended from heaven, or that he came downe from heaven in regard of his humane Nature, but thus the son of man descends; the Reader must remember that there is a vast difference betwixt these two expessions; the one of them is true, and the other false, for the son of man denotes not the Nature but the Person, the person of the son was at once both in heaven and in earth. The Person which is both God and man is every where essentially present at the same time, but now, as he was the Son of man, that is, taken in the notion of the humane nature so had he not at all been in heaven, nor descended from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor was at that instant in heaven, nor is it now being exalted to glory in earth, for a finite nature cannot be infinite, but is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to a place.</p>
                  <p>The next objected place out of the same Evangelist, <hi>John</hi> 6.62. what if you shall see the Son of man ascend up where he may be free: this place is not paralell to the former, nor a confirmation
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:118911:100"/>of it: the same Tense here is not in the originall, he that was in heaven and descended from heaven, is not in heaven, but Christ was in heaven before, and therefore he (being on earth) is not now in heaven. I deny the Major, it is false, Christ was in heaven, but it followeth not that he is not in heaven: see your errour by other examples taken out of Scripture; the world was in the beginning, therefore the word is not now, the word was with God, will it follow therefore the word is not with God: that word was God, therefore the word is not God, is this sound arguing? in him was life, therefore life is not in him, can you say so? he was in the world, therefore he is not in the world, are these Inferences taken out of one chapter of Saint <hi>John</hi> 1. to name no more Scriptures to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable? just of this stamp is your proof to justifie your corupt tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slation, <hi>John</hi> 3.13.</p>
                  <p>Seven times is it said in this sixth of <hi>Iohn,</hi> that Christ descended from heaven, and by consequence he was in heaven before, the drift of our Saviour is to withdraw the <hi>Capernaites</hi> from a grosse con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of a carnal eating of the flesh of the Son of man, which as in nature was incredible, so was it not possible for them to do, if they would advisedly consider of the great distance betwixt his body and those which should feed on him, which is as great, as betwixt hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, as is betwixt the beginning of the world and the end thereof, and his end and drift was to raise up their hearts from the thoughts of a corporall to a spirituall eating thereof by faith, which cannot be hindred, by distance of time and place, and which was also in a heavenly manner done, when Christ was not incarnated, for all the holy ones which lived before his Nativity, did verily and in truth feed on him, and were in their souls nourished by that blessed food of life, for this is the strength and excellency of saith, comfortably to rely on those precious promises in Christ, which were not then accomplished, as well as on present truths; Christ then mentioning his bodily Ascension into heavean, where he had been before, though not in his body, but in his Deity, and shewing also, that he shall not alwayes touching his corporal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence converse with them on earth, and moreover declaring that he always hath been and shall be ever the food of his people, doth clearly evince the verity of his two Natures, which the Adversary doth peremptorily oppose.</p>

                  <p>Glorious things indeed are spoken of Christs humanity, but I do deny that the most excellent things are spoken of Christ under the notion of a man, for some things are a tributed to him, which were meerely Divine, as the Attributes of God, and the Decrees which are immanent acts, and some works, as creation, guberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and others, which do not appertain to the humane nature, at least not primarily, as to give grace, forgive sinnes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but onely instrumentally, not that it is a separate instrument, as a Saw an Axe is to the Carpenter, but conjunct, as the Humane body is to the reasonable soul: this and the like to these most glorious things are truly verified of him who is the most High God, nor can they truly appertain to any created person.</p>
                  <p>Now that you may not complain, that we do vilifie the humane nature of, our Saviour; be it known unto you, that we do warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably plead for many glorious priviledges, which you do unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably deny to his great dishonour. First, that he was conceived without the seed of man, not apart from the person of the Word, and Secondly, that it alone was assumed into the Unity of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Son of God. Thirdly, that the properties of either nature are really attributed to the other in the concrete, that is, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son by vertue of that Union. Fourthly, that in the Offices of the Messias, each nature hath its proper operation, with communion of the other, the properties and differences of each nature being entire to it self. Fifthly that whole Christ, God and man, in both natures is present with and governs the Church, as the head is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent with the members: these are Prerogative and glorious things spoken of the humane nature, which you <hi>Mr.</hi> Biddle will not in a true sense ascribe to him.</p>
                  <p>Besides, glorious things are spoken of Christ, in regard of the grace of Unction, which albeit, it is not in its own nature infinite, but a concreated being, yet in the nature of grace, it had no limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the reason here of is, because grace was given to Christ, not as to a particular, but to an universal cause, whence it was to be derived from him to others, <hi>for of his fulnes we all receive grace,</hi> 1 John 16. our
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:118911:102"/>light is from his Son, our water is from his unexhausted fountain, our sap from his root, and congruous it is because of the grace of Union, the humane nature being united to the word, that he being nearer the fountain and prime cause of grace than any other creatures, should more abound in the degree and quantity of grace than all others: the nearer any one is in blood to a King the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of honour being taken in that consideration, the more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable he is, so that in respect of God, these graces were most meet for our Saviour: 1. That he might most exactly do his Fathers work, and glorifie him. 2. In regard of himself, that he might be a meet and alsufficient Mediatour, and 3. In respect of his chosen people, that they might receive all good, both spirituall and eterna from him.</p>

                  <p>First, I must tell the Adversary, and I desire the Christian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to observe it, that he doth not fitly speak as it becometh a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, nor agreeably to the language of Gods holy Spirit; we do not say, nor hath Gods word taught us to speak in that manner that the nature of man is sustained in another nature, for the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature as simply and absolutely such considered, was not made flesh, for then no doubt, all the three persons should have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnated, which to affirm is not consonant to Scripture, and the Catholick faith, but it was onely the Son of God, or the Divine Nature of the second Person of the holy Trinity, which did sustain the humane nature, and the great Dignity conferred on it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Do you Christian Readers, abstract the humane Nature of Christ, I do not say that this can be really done, but let it be done in a mental consideration from his blessed person, and then I do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouch, that all the graces, which were plentifully bestowed on the humane nature, could not have enabled him to be a King, a Priest, a Prophet, our Saviour, our Judge with qualifications, to perform those sacred Offices for our eternal happinesse, he might have been I confesse a happy man in regard of himself, but considering that it was Gods pleasure, that his Justice should be satisfied, or else man should never be saved, he could not have been a happy Saviour for us: besides it must not be forgotten, the Man, and Sonne of of Man do note the Divine Person, though so demoninated from the humane nature.</p>

Hence is there
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:118911:103"/>(as I have often sayd) a communication of the Divine properties to man, not by Phisicall communication or effusion, as the heat is from the fire, which is inherent as an accident in the water; for if so then would there follow a confusion and conversion, and an equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the natures, and naturall properties, but this communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is personall, whereby the humane nature subsists in the Person of the Son of God, and it is called the Grace of Union, which is in regard of the thing that is, the personall subsistence gratiously be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed on the humane nature in the Virgins womb, was infinite; yet observe that the relation of dependency founded on the humane Nature, whereby it is <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>This Section may either be true or false, as it is capable of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious interpretation, if the Adversary meaneth, as he must accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own principles, that the Person of the Prophet did not subsist in the dayes that <hi>Moses</hi> Prophesied of him, as in some sort future, then it is false and justly denyed by us, for <hi>The Word was in the beginning</hi> (of the Creation) 1. <hi>John</hi> 1. and himselfe, whose wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness is undeniably true, saith of himselfe, <hi>Before Abraham was I am,</hi> and then of necessity it must follow, that it was also true, <hi>Before Moses was I am,</hi> and he was in a comfortable way alwayes, the Prophet of the Catholick Church: and this is one Reason among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, why he is called <hi>The Word, the Embassadour of his heavenly Father, the Angel of the Covenant, Counsellor,</hi> and by such like titles. But how? this office he powerfully and savingly performed from the beginning, but it was done in reference to the humane Nature to be assumed into the unity of his Person, he alwayes by his Spirit repeated the Divine Truths which were to be believed and practised, and that for the most part by the Ministry of his Servants deputed to that office, and he was the person that alwayes enlightned his people in all ages with saving knowledge and other sanctifying Graces.</p>
                  <p>It is very true that he did not subsist both God and Man, till many ages after this Prophesie of <hi>Moses,</hi> we are far from such a dotage to assert that the humanity of Christ was eternall; but we say, that he was only in the form of God, till the fulness of time when he tooke flesh of the blessed Virgin <hi>Mary, Gal.</hi> 4.4. and whereas you infer much less was he the Lord God that raised up himseife to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, this is granted in a sense. he raised not up himself <hi>totaliter</hi> to

                  <p>Besides, consider Christ in that respect, as he was really raised up, to be a Prophet in time, which was accomplished in the humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and so is he not formally the Lord God, for who will or can assert the humanity of the Son of God to be very God?</p>

                  <p>That Jesus Christ was truly man none of ours do make any que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and that he did also work miracles as he pleased, and when he would; the History of the Gospel doth clearly hold forth, as also that God by him wrought those wonderfull Works, but for better understanding hereof we are to take notice that Christ is a Receiver from another by three degrees.</p>
                  <p>First, as he was the Son of God, he receved his Divine Nature by eternal generation; and thus he hath one and the self same numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call substance with, and from the Father only, the Father is alone originally that Deity, which Christ is not originally; whatsoever Christ thus receiveth, he hath it naturally and eternally, and tis not bestowed on him by way of favour and benevolence in this respect Though God the Father works miracles by the Son, and an order is observed in working them, yet is not the Son of God subordinate to him, or an instrument of these glorious works.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:118911:104"/>
                  <p>Secondly, Christ is a Receiver in this particular, that the Humane Nature hath had the grace, the greatest grace that man was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of, to be united to the Person of his only begotten Son, in this he differeth from all men, because he is that man of whom God is himselfe a part.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, from the Grace of union is derived the Grace of Unction, by meanes whereof sundry eminent Graces have followed as effects from the Deity into our nature, which is joyned with it, enriching our nature with such degrees of grace and influences of the Deity, both into the soul and body proportionable, to the great imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Saviour, and to his own purposes, ends, and Counsels, and we will not stick to grant, that God by Christ in respect of the humane Nature was the principal, and our Nature the instrumentall cause of working miracles.</p>
                  <p>We do further from these miraculous Works conclude, that our Saviour is the true God, for God alone works wonders, and our Saviour convinceth the Jews his maligning opposers, that because he hath power to work miracles, he had power to forgive sins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.5. which none but God could do, for the clearing whereof we may take notice of three kindes of works wrought by Christ our Saviour, as <hi>Sophronius</hi> in that notable Epistle of his doth distinguish them in the sixt generall Synod, <hi>Activ.</hi> 11.</p>
                  <p>First some are meerly Divine. as to create the world.</p>
                  <p>Secondly some are meerly humane, as to eat and sleep, and such like naturall actions, the formall principle whereof is the Humane Nature, yet to be considered as existing in the person of the Son of God, and not without it: these were actions of the Mediator, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they kept him in the being of a Mediator, but not parts and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his Mediatourship, as the Israelites eating and drinking in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was no part of the task of brick imposed on them, but qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified them to perform their task.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, some actions are partly Divine, and partly humane, I instance in most of the miracles of our Saviour, as one is, to walke upon the waters, for as simply to walk on them was a humane action, yet to give firmnesse and solidity to the liquid waters (if the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles was in the waters) to bear up the weight of his heavy body, or if the miracle was in the body of our Lord, by holding it up, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise that it should not sink; this I say, was an action of the Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: thus was it also touching other miracles wrought by our blessed
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:118911:105"/>Saviour, both the Deity and Humanity concurred to their produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but in different manner, as in healing the sick, giving Sight to the Blind, Hearing to the Deafe, Raising the Dead: the efficacy of the Spirit of the Deity, as the principall cause was seen in working the miracle, and the humane nature concurred instrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally both in respect of his body and his soul, in regard of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that he touched them, or they him that were to be healed, or spake to them as to <hi>Lazarus</hi> lying in the grave, <hi>Come forth,</hi> or commanded the Devil to come out of them that were possessed by him; in respect of his soul, that he desired, approved, and rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in that supernatural work, which the divine power brought to passe, this shewed that the humane nature neither had, nor possibly could have that Divine power residing in it to work miracles, but it was onely the Instrument of the Deity in these words of wonder.</p>
                  <p>Bid. <hi>Secondly, When he saith, that Jesus being exalted at the right hand of God, and hauing received the promise of the Holy Ghost from the Father poured it out on the Apostles, this argueth, that he gave the Holy Ghost as a man, since he neither could be exalted by God, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the promise of the Holy Ghost from the Father, for according to the supposition of the Adversaries themselves, the holy Spirit proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from Christ, as he is God, as well as from the Father, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the holy Spirit himself is so far from being God (in as much as it is absurd, yea impossible that God should be received by promise from any one) as that he is not equal to Christ, as man, since his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation, because he that is given and disposed of by another, must be inferiour in Dignity to him that giveth him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The Son of God, which did first humble himself by taking our nature upon him, descended afterwards much lower, and in regard of his flesh became obedient, so far as to suffer even the cursed death of the Crosse for our salvation, hecause it was his Fathers will and pleasure that he should do so, he thus dying and being bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, was brought to the lowest condition, insomuch that his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed enemies thought, as the brethren of <hi>Joseph</hi> did, when they had sold him to strangers, that they had so taken him out of the way, that they should never again be troubled with him; but see to our unspeakable comfort how much they were deceived? as Christ by his manhood had glorified God on earth, in his suffering, so God hath glorified that humane nature, and exalted him in Dignity, far above all Angels and men, and he now sitting at the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:118911:105"/>right hand of God, hath fulnesse of power over the whole world, and fills the Church with the gracious and happy fruits of his saving presence, and exerciseth the Dominion, wherein the humanity o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Christ is inseparably united to the Deity of the Son of God, but doth this concession touching the humane nature infer a denial of the Divine? in no wise, this is done by no better Logick, than by our asserting one constituting part of a created person; to think it convincing, that there is no other, as if I should say, this man hath a body, and prove plainly that he hath so, therefore he hath not a soul, and suppose it onely without proof.</p>
                  <p>You infer that Jesus Christ gave the Holy Ghost, as a man, this <hi>quatenus</hi> and Inference is denyed, this follows, he that gave the Holy Ghost was a man, and his manhood was inseparably united to the person of the Son of God, and is no where actually sever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him but the conjunction with the Deity is extended as far as the Deity, though the actuall position thereof is restrained to a limited place; the infinite word is not divisible into parts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not in part, but wholly be incarnated as the light in the beginning, which was created by God did enlighten the Creation, but after the Sun and stars were created, the world was illuminated by them, so in our present case, the Deity which before our Lords in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation wrought all things without man, doth now in the affairs of the Church work nothing wherein the assumed nature of man is absent, or not in a sense co-working with it: the promise then of the holy Ghost (to clear the meaning thereof) is the holy Ghost promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, &amp; it is in another place called the promise of the Father, <hi>Act.</hi> 14.5. or the promise which Christ gave the Disciples from the Father, which was meant of the liberal gifts of the spirit, &amp; this comforter he promised to send to the Apostles, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.16. and 16.7. now <hi>Ss Peter</hi> alledgeth this promise, and 33. <hi>c.</hi> 2. that the Jews might undoubtedly know that this great gift of speaking with tongues was not suddenly given but that our Lord Christ was faithful and true to perform his promise made to them, the Father of our Lord Christ poured out the holy Ghost on him, not as he was God, for that was not possible, but as he was our Mediatour, to prepare &amp; furnish him with gifts for that high office, the human nature of his divine person must have eminent graces conferred on it without measure, not simply infinite, because that nature is simply finite; observe then, Christ receives this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise from his Father, as he is our Mediatour, and he sent the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:118911:106"/>Holy Ghost on the Apostles as he was God; it is the office of our Mediator, as he is our Mediator to reconcile us to his Father, and to confer on us his servants in some degree, what he receives from the Father, so far as is expedient for our salvation.</p>
                  <p>Our supposition is a true position, that the Holy Ghost proceeds both from God the Father, and God the Son, in an ineffable and inconceiveable manner to us, but not from man, nor is this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession properly in time, but from all eternity, whereas you say that Christ gave the Holy Ghost, as he was man. You mean by his humane glorified nature, this we do absolutely deny, and we are sure you can never prove it, the Son of God which is our happy Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, gave him to his Disciples? but how was he given? in regard of the plentifull gifts which he bestowed on them; he was from the beginning given to the Elect to sanctifie them, and in regard of common Graces to Reprobates also, but not in that ample and great measure as he was given in the latter dayes; the Holy Ghost thus was not given, because Jesus Christ was not yet glorified, <hi>John</hi> 7.39. which is clearly meant of the Holy Ghosts visible descending upon the Disciples in the appearance of cloven Tongues like fire, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.2.33. by which he should give testimony of the truth of all that Christ had said unto them, <hi>John</hi> 15.26. and secondly testifie also to others, that whatsoever they should teach was also the will of God. and so authorize them to give solemn testimony of the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Jesus Christ, and give them commission and graces to discharge their whole Ministery, as choice Witnesses now designed by him to declare to Israel, and not only to Jews, but to Gentiles also what Christ had done, and preached in their presence, and that he was risen from the dead. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> on <hi>Act.</hi> 1. Note is, see also <hi>John</hi> 6.4.7. <hi>He that was man gave the Holy Ghost,</hi> but not as he was man. Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> that sits doth write, but not as he sitteth; he sitting doth eat, but not as he sits, for then every one that sits should write and eat: This is a transparent fallacy.</p>
                  <p>You tell us (in a Parenthesis) that <hi>it is impossible that God should be received by promise from any,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Consider well, and this will prove the Holy Ghost to be God, because he is at once received of many, and of those which are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant one from another; 'tis a strange creature to admiration that can be in this Apostle; and in others essentially as far remote a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:118911:106"/>East from West, in this place and not in that which is contiguous to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Secondly, it is no absurdity at all, no false assertion, but a Divine Truth full of heavenly comfort, that God the Father by his Son should give the Holy Ghost, who was essentialy every where, and in all times present to be in another way present, that is, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to promise, gratiously present, and in a speciall manner to dwell with his Servants: See my answer against <hi>Biddle</hi> in defence of the Holy Ghost, 7.

                  <p>To this first I answer, that the Holy Ghost is so far from being inferior to the Humane Nature, that he is in that respect superior to him, not only because in that consideration he sent Christ, <hi>Esay</hi> 61.1. This is a strong Argument against the Adversary, because he would by this prove the Holy Ghost to be inferior to God, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he received his created being from him: <hi>He was conceived by the Holy Ghost, Mat.</hi> 1. as also because he was corporally raised from death by him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. and Christ himselfe saith, <hi>It was a greater sin which is committed against the Holy Ghost, then that sin which is committed against the Son of Man, Mat</hi> 12.31.32.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the Adversary seems to grant that the Son was not grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then the Holy Ghost. till his exaltation. First this crosseth his Exposition of <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. when he was in the form of God, and equall to God, was he not then the second Person of the holy Trinity, and greater then the Holy Ghost? 2. I deny that in his humane nature he was, when exalted greater then the Spirit of God; the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is too weak to prove it, and false, for the Humane Nature gives not the Holy Ghost to the Servants of God, but tis the blessed Father by the Son of God; it is the Person of the Son, and not the Humane Nature in a seperated consideration that gives him.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, although the Holy Ghost be given in regard of his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces by the Son of God, yet doth it not follow that he is inferior in dignity to him that gives him; the Son of man gives himself for us, &amp; is given for us, yea and the holy Ghost doth give himselfe to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his grace is from his free and absolute power, <hi>The Spirit blows where he will, John</hi> 3. <hi>and divides to every one his Gifts as he pleaseth,</hi> 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. See of this largely my answer to his 7. v. against the Holy Ghost.</p>

                  <p>The Text hath been fully discussed above p. 1067. which doth wel prove that the Humane Nature was a Person, but that he was a Person that was made Lord, which none of us denie, and that he was raised and honoured by his Father, not simply, as he was the Son of God, and really in the Divine Nature, which is most high. But that he was in his Humane Nature annoynted to be King, and to have the regency and dominion of the Church, which is so to be understood, not that he in his manhood was simply before that time without possession of the same power, but because the full use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the exercise of this power was suspended, till the state of his humiliation, which vailed Divine Majesty, was laid aside, and this also shall cease, when there shall be no Church militant to governe, no enemy to subdue and annoy his chosen ones.</p>
                  <p>Touching the Description of the Trinity feigned out of your own brain, I say at present, the Son of God by being made flesh, hath changed the manner of his personall subsistance, which before was solitary, but hath now associated the humane Nature to his Person, without any alteration accruing thereby to the Nature of God: the Son of God I say is the second Person of the glorious Trinity, though not so denominated by his Humane Nature highly exalted, for upon this account the blessed Trinity should not have been at all till above four thousands of years after the Creation, which is irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall to conceive: the Holy Ghost is now and ever was the third Person of the holy Trinity called a Gift, but not such a gift as is

                  <p>Christ is called a Counsellor, not in a Passive, but Active sense, not because he was made acquainted with Gods Counsels, but for giving Counsell, <hi>Esa.</hi> 40. who as a Counsellor hath taught him? he was joyned in Counsel with his Father from all eternity; yet will I not deny, but he was also a Counsellor in your sense, because he acquaints us with the Counsels of God, by what means we may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain eternall life.</p>
                  <p>A made God is not a mighty God <hi>El Gibbor</hi> is a mighty God in a proper sense appropriated to the most high God of Israel. I reason thus:</p>
                  <p>The strong God is truly and properly the most high God, the God of Israel, Iesus Christ is the strong God. <hi>Ergo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The major proposition is so evident, that no instance can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to weaken the truth thereof: this Epithite of strong doth not weaken or change the strength and signification of the word God, no more then the like titles, by calling him the great God, the living God, the just God, and the like, but it hath use to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish him from made Gods, who are not mighty Gods but weak men, or Angels, and at the command of this mighty God, albeit seperately, <hi>El</hi> God is attributed sometimes to Magistrates, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.1. and <hi>Gibbarim,</hi> mighty to the Captains of <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars</hi> Army, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 32.12. yet in this Scripture, these two joyntly are never attributed to any but to the God of Israel. Thus is God described, <hi>The remnant shall return, even the remnant of</hi> Jacob <hi>to the mighty God.</hi> Nor doth this title only distinguish the true God from all other Gods, but it is added to the name of God, when he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in his glory and magnificence, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 10.17. <hi>The Lord your God is a God of gods, a great God, a mighty and a terrible God:</hi> the like also <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.32. and <hi>Jerem.</hi> 32.18. <hi>Thou art the great the mighty God, the Lord of Hostes is his name:</hi> yea, and it is added to the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> for the greater <hi>Emphasis;</hi> who is this King of glory? <hi>the Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battell, Psal.</hi> 24.8.</p>

                  <p>Our grand Adversary the Devil cannot endure the Doctrine of the Deity of the Son, whereby his head was chiefly broken, and therefore he provoketh his choice instruments to accuse it as blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, tending to the dishonour of the most high God, and they that have this his mark upon their foreheads, openly professe their abhorrency from it, and in their hands do write against it, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to vent their sophistical Wares to delude ignorant and unsta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fouls.</p>

                  <p>Secondly, our Saviour sheweth that the Jews ought not to take offence for his calling himself the Son of God, albeit he had been onely man, for be it granted, that I am onely man, yet ought you not to judge this my speech a strange language, for in your Law (the Divine word in <hi>Psal.</hi> 82.) Magistrates who were but ordinary Judges of those times, which were chosen by men, and advanced to that office, have their Authority from God, and are Gods Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerents,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:118911:111"/>yea and have the Title of God put upon them, <hi>I said ye are Gods and Sons of the most high:</hi> how much more may I who have a commission, immediatly from God the Father, and who sent me into the World to be a Mediator betwixt God and men, without blasphemy say, that I am the Son of God? this being granted, yet will it not follow that Christ is no otherwise the Son of God then Kings and Magistrates are denominated his Sons, but our Saviour vanquished the slander of the Jewes by that divine testimony, and proveth thereby, that it was no blasphemy in him, nor dishonour done to God to call him his Father; to this I may adde with learned <hi>Camer.</hi> that the knowledge of Christs Divinity was not clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in those dayes as it was after his resurrection and ascention into Heaven, nor doth Christ so evidently call himselfe God, as he was afterwards famously known to be, but this he leaves to be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from his gratious words &amp; miraculous works, that he was the naturall Son of God, and by consequent that God was his Father, which relation lifts up Christ above a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Thirdly, I may clear up this testimony as other Writers before me have done in this manner.

The name of the Son of God, or the chiefe God; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence is proved, because Christ was sanctified, and set apart to be a Mediator and Saviour of the World, and he sanctifies himselfe for the sake of his Disciples, <hi>John</hi> 17.10 sanctification is a most holy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stination of a most holy Person, that he sanctifying himselfe might sanctifie all the Elect He was sanctified, and he sanctified himself; he was given, and he gave himself; the Father and the Son joyntly acted in that gratious work, and he being sent must really exist be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was sent, and this office, as I have often said, he could not

Christ speakes, and <hi>Bisterf.</hi> observes that many of the Psalmes which have this title, <hi>To Asaph,</hi> do treat of the Kingdome of Christ, at or after the conversion of the Jewes, and 2. the words of this Psalm do prove it, God said, <hi>You are the Sons of the most high:</hi> had it been meant of God the Father only, it would have been said <hi>My Sons, v.</hi> 6. and <hi>v.</hi> 8. <hi>Arise O God and judge the Earth</hi> (that is the Office of our Saviour) <hi>for thou shalt inherit all Nations:</hi> all shall in time become Christs, who is the King of the Saints, <hi>Revel.</hi> 15.3. and in <hi>John</hi> 10.34. is it not written in the Law, <hi>I</hi> (the Messias) <hi>have said ye are gods?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, Christ doth appeal to his Works, <hi>ver.</hi> 37. that the Father was in him, and he in the Father, that they were one, which none of the Prophets ever asserted, from that which is more known, Christ teacheth that which is lesse knowne, which proofe is most popular, and most efficatious: this Scripture then (all things prudently consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered) is strong against the Adversary to prove the Deity of the Son of God,</p>

                  <p>The design of the Adversary is to intangle us with a contradiction, out of which we can easily extricate our selves: I say it is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to say Christ was conceived of the Holy Ghost, and borne of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and to say again, he was not conceived of the Holy Ghost nor born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> if these seemingly oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site propositions be not spoken in the same respect, though they spoken of the same person; no person was borne of the Virgin but the Son of God; no person was baptized but the Son of God, no Person but the Son of God was condemned and crucified. Hence is it that the Jews are said to <hi>have crucified the Lord of glory,</hi> death is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed to the Lord of glory, wherof the divine nature was not capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, &amp; therfore we must needs understand the whole Person of Christ, who being the Lord of glory was crucified indeed but not in that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for which he is termed the Lord of glory, which one only point of our Christian Faith (the infinitenes I mean of his Divine Person) is the ground of all things believed concerning our happiness, by that which Christ either did or suffered as he was man in our behalfe.</p>
                  <p>Upon this ground I deny your consequence, if Christ had a Divine nature in being the eternal Son of God; the Angel would not have told <hi>Joseph,</hi> that what was conceived in the womb of his wife was of the Holy Spirit, otherwise the eternal Son himself, would be by the Spirit, and be caused by the Spirit, these are loose, groundlesse conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences easily blown away with the breath of the truth, and by the light of the former discourse: mark then the Son of God simply, as he is God, &amp; solely the Son of God is not conceived by the holy Ghost, nor born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but the Son of God in respect of the humane N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Secondly it was the work of the Holy Spirit, that the virgin should conceive without the seed of man, and that he should not have a Father immediately on earth. Thirdly that the masse which the Son of man assumed, should be purified and that corruption should not be derived to him by the chanel of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral generation, 4. And that the Divine and humane nature, should be in an admirable manner united in one person; this Son of God was begotten of his Father by eternal generation before the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet became also man of the substance of his mother by tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:118911:113"/>generation, this was wrought in a moment, and wonderfully the power of the Holy Ghost shall overshadow thee, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. as it is true, that thou (O blessed virgin, shalt conceive by the powerfull operation of the Holy Ghost, and not by mans seed, and therefore thou shalt be a Mother virgin, so is it as true, that that which thou shalt conceive and bear, is the Son of God, yet is it not an orthodoxal expression to say, Christ as he is man, or according to his humane nature, is the Son of God, for in this consideration he is onely the Son of man, of <hi>David,</hi> yet may we by the warrant of Scripture language say, God manifested in the flesh is the Son of God, or this man which is called Jesus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is the Son of God, begotten by his Father, by eternal generation, and is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called the onely begotten Son of God.</p>
                  <p>You adde, had Christ been the eternal Son of God, he needed not the assistance of the Holy Ghost to furnish him with a humane nature, being himself able to produce it, unlesse you will say, his Divine nature was idle.</p>
                  <p>I answer, all this is spoken both ignorantly and blasphemously, for the holy Ghost had no efficiency or causality in the incarnation of our blessed saviour, which was not common to the Trinity, for as Father, son and holy Ghost are inseparable, touching the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Essence and power of working, so likewise are they inseparable in their operations. The persons of the holy Trinity, have one ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute, entire Essence and existence, and therefore being one and the same God, it followeth that their transient and outward actions in reference to the Creatures, are undivided and common to them all, as one formal Principle of them; albeit, I deny not that power by a phrase of speech, called by the Schoolmen appropriation, is ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to the Father, Wisdome to Gods Son, and holinesse to the blessed spirit, so that to speak properly, all the three persons, which are one essentiall and absolute God, blessed for ever, did without any peculiar efficiency to any one of them frame the humane nature of Christ, though it was terminative (as they say) assumed onely by the second person, which denotes the dependency of that hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature on the Divine Person, without any difference of cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality betwixt them. Tis a common comparison to illustrate this truth; three Vergins doe joyntly make up a garment for one of them onely to weare, so all the three persons as one cause did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Humane Nature, yet was it taken only into the Person of
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:118911:113"/>the Son of God. Christ became Man, not in regard of the Divine Nature simply, which is common to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, but as it subsists in the Son of God, tis true if we respect the original of working there is a difference, the Father as he is of himself, and from no other, so doth he work from himselfe, not from the Son, and the Son as he is from the Father, so he doth also work from the Father, but because there is no distinction of the Persons in regard of the formall, essentiall principle of working, it follows there is no distinction or separation of the Divine Persons in the work it self.</p>
                  <p>It was therefore both an absurd and a blasphemous inference, and that, as you say, from our principle, either that it was needlesse for the Holy Ghost to frame the body of our Lord, or else that the Divine Nature of the Son of God was idle: will you grant then (which by this your reason must needs follow) because Christ was conceived by the Holy Ghost, therefore God the Father was idle, and not the prime Worker of this marvellous conception, unheard of in the world ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>To this I answer, If <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> in his second Apology (for in that and not the first, there is som thing to be found tending that way) takes the Holy Ghost for the Son of God, his Exposition is singular, and we own it not, nor are we bound to maintain it; they which do seem to the vulgar sort to value the Fathers Writings at a high rate, yet will not defend, but reject a single testimony, when it is opposite to all, or the greater number of the Ancients, and do answer, <hi>One Swallow makes not a Summer: Sextus Senexsis Biblioth. lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Annotat.</hi> 247. yet albeit <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> might faile in his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of that sacred Text, his judgement notwithstanding is clear against you for the Deity of the Son of God; yea, and this very place might have informed you to say now no more. For how should he
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:118911:114"/>be able to make of the Virgin, and assume our nature, had he not been God? the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> said, <hi>How can this be, seeing I know not a man,</hi> Luk. 1.34. doth not the Angel confine her by saying, <hi>Nothing is unpossible to God,</hi> v. 37. If the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Son of God, it follows that he was God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I do not a little wonder if that Ancient Father and blessed Martyr should take the Holy Ghost in that sense, that he is alledged by the Adversary; my reason is, because he often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Holy Ghost, both in that Apology and in his other tracts, as distinct from Father and Son, and never confounds them, and why he should in one place so mistake, I see no ground; this I am sure he did not, because as you say he was pressed with any difficulty in the Text.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, the <hi>Martyr</hi> possibly may mean the Son of God, not as he is distinguished from the Holy Ghost, but spoken of him in opposition to the Creatures, that no Angel or Man had a hand in that wonderfull conception, but not denying the same miracle to be wrought by the Holy Ghost, nor indeed could he exclude him, because he asserts in the Treatise of the Exposition of faith that the three Divine Persons are but one Essence which powerfully workes by all three <hi>conjunctim.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Lastly, if thus he meant not, then perhaps he mentions the Son of God in regard of the term <hi>ad quem,</hi> in what this Nature was assumed into, and depended on the Person, not of the Father, or Holy Ghost, but of the Son of God, in this regard it is erroneous to ascribe the worke terminative to any but to the Sonne of God, whose person, wee grant was compleat and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in it selfe from all eternity, nor was there any thing wanting to the perfection of it, yet in regard of the perfection of one end, I mean the Salvation of the Churh, there was wanting the humane Nature, which must be assumed by the Son of God, that the Elect amongst the Sons of men might be saved.</p>

                  <p>It is no difficult matter to answer both the Text of Scripture, and the questions inferred from it, for the first, albeit Christ was God, yet was he also man, and the annointing him, the consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to the office of a mediatour, the largest gifts bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and setting him over the Church, and above all his fellows both men and Angels, was by the graces of the spirit, which not by small drops, but (as it were) buckets full were poured out on him in a high degree, which was requisite for him that should be our mediatour, but he was also annointed, <hi>i.e.</hi> marked out by a voice from heaven, <hi>This is my beloved Son</hi> and by the coming down of the spirit upon him, and was demonstrated thereby to be the promised Messias, <hi>Isa.</hi> 61.1. <hi>Luke</hi> 4.18. what makes this for your purpose? surely nothing at all.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

                  <p>Christ was truly a man, and acted at present as a man; the presence of his Disciples was a comfort to him, and when they had forsaken him, and outward comforts failed, a holy Angel from heaven, an invisible comforter seasonably acted, and strengthened him, most probably this was done by representing to him such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations and benefits of his death, as might make him at that time to bear the heavy burthen chearfully.</p>
                  <p>Your Objection, then the Divine Nature would be idle and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse borders at least on blaspemy, the Son of God as touching his Divine Nature, being a most free agent, may suspend some acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as to his humane nature, and as to our head Christ Iesus, so likewise to us his members, and not alwayes communicate those ravishing rayes and those liberall influences, to which joy is insepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably annexed, the inference: then the Divine Nature is idle and uselesse, is both false, scandalous and blaspemous, for nothing is idle and fruitlesse, but that which works not when it ought to work, and which bears not fruit in its due time and season, as <hi>Scaliger de subtil.

                  <p>These specious Interrogations which seem to have much strength in them, are in truth very weake and easily answered, by distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, as often we have done, of his Natures; thus he that was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry God could cry out in his Humane Nature directly to God his Father. <hi>Was he</hi> (say you) <hi>his own God?</hi> an uncouth phrase: we must now look upon Christ voluntarily humbling himselfe as our Surety to a cursed death for the sins of his people, and being in this condition, he not only might be forsaken, but it was expedient that he should be forsaken of God in regard of the Divine Oeconomy, and the work he was to finish for our salvation.</p>
                  <p>I will take liberty to expatiate on this comfortable Text, which argued then an uncomfortable condition of our Lord and Saviour: <hi>How could he expostulate with God</hi> (say you) <hi>if he were God?</hi> to this I answer, he did not expostulate with God by way of reprehension of him for his present state, as it is taken <hi>John</hi> 8.44. <hi>Why do ye not understand my speech?</hi> nor by way of murmurring against God, as the Israelites did often for want of water, and for want of flesh, <hi>Numb.</hi> 11.18. nor because he was ignorant and forgetfull of the reason of his passion, which is the usuall ground of our Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. How should there be forgetfulness in him, when he should most of all remember why he suffered? even for the working out of our Redemption. What then? shall we say that this is a question of admiration, like that in the Psalm 36.8. <hi>How excellent is thy Mercy O God!</hi> Can it be that thou shouldst so love the World, that thou shouldst forsake me thy deare Son to redeem the world? or shall we say that Christ debateth the matter with his Father fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly, reverently, and holily, which Interrogation ariseth from a filial confidence in him, as <hi>David</hi> did in his misery, <hi>Psal.</hi> 42.9. <hi>Why hast thou forsaken me?

                     </gap>, but was as a Garment put on, never to be put off againe; nor was hee forsaken in regard of that <hi>influxus conservativus</hi> of God, there was no losse or impai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his holy Graces: his grief was intolerable which constrained his holy nature, without prejudice to the fulnesse of his sanctity to cry out and groane for these great evils which he indured. Thus <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of innocency, or a blessed Angel would have done, by necessity, not by corruption of nature, if a burthen too heavy for them had been layd upon them, this was not unlike the shaking of pure water in a Christall glasse, which hath no settlings in it, it remaineth pure. Lastly, in this complaint he wanted not the assurance of full deliverance after a short suffering, how else could he have said in the same period, <hi>my God, my God?</hi> how could he pray with strong cries as he did to his Father, who heard him al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways? how else could he say to <hi>Caiaphas, thou shalt see the Son of Man comming in the Clouds of Heaven?</hi> how could he have promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to that converted Thiefe which was crucified with him, that he should be that very day with him in Paradise? how else could he have commended his soul into his Fathers hands?</p>
                  <p>Thus was he not forsaken: how then positively was he forsaken? first in that the Father did not protect him, and rescue him out of the hands of his cruel, bloudy, and mercilesse enemies, in this sense <hi>David</hi> prayes to God <hi>Psal.</hi> 38.2. <hi>Forsake me not O Lord.</hi> Secondly, God may be said to forsake Christ, because he with-held that solace and comfort from him which he formerly injoyed, for albeit joy doth naturally flow from the Vision of God, as light doth from the Sun, and heat from the fire, yet as the Sun somtimes, as now in our Lords passion lost his light, and the fire burned not the three noble Confessors, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. <hi>Sic deitas cohibuit redundantiam beatificae visionis,</hi> saith the Canarian Bishop <hi>Melchior Canus loc. lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. and <hi>Maldonate</hi> cals this <hi>Compressionem Deitatis,</hi> Christ did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly see, but injoy God for the present, as a man in great distresse may eat of the fruit of his own Tree, and look upon his dearest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:118911:117"/>without delight, the Sun goes downe to him at Noone day. Nor is this all, we are not yet come to the Pillars of <hi>Hercules;</hi> the Father poured on him the infinite Sea of his wrath, the due defert of our sins, as he was our Surety, and as he was to be our Satisfier; this was done to him, so far as it might stand with the dignity and worthinesse of the Person, the holiness of his Nature, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his Worke of our Redemption. Christ-suffered great tortures in his body, but greater in his soule; <hi>Gùm sit tantus dolor exterior, interior tamen planctus gravior,</hi> the anguish of his soul far exceeded the tortures of his hody, and the invisible crosse did more afflict him then the visible; and he having experience in his owne feeling of the bitternesse of his Crosse, hath learned experimentally to have compassion on afflicted Spirits, which is a misery of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Hence were made those deep impressions in all the faculties of his soul, natural, vital, animal, and rational, which, as is thought, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened his death as an inward cause of it, so that he was dead sooner then the Thieves which were crucified with him, yea, so soon that <hi>Pilate</hi> himselfe marvelled, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.44. how else happens it that Martyrs have rejoyced, and in their sufferings, and at their death? <hi>Miles poterit, imperator non audebit?

                  <p>Gods revealed will was made known to <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve, At the day thou eatest the forbidden fruit, thou shalt dye the death:</hi> this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture must be some way fulfilled, the <hi>Socinians</hi> do hold that death is not a punnishment of sin, but the condition of our Nature, and that man should have died albeit he never had sinned; and they seem to maintaine this errour, which the Catholick Church never held, saith S. <hi>Austen Epist.</hi> 106. that they with the <hi>Pelagians, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. de Haeres. c.</hi> 88. might be the better able to defend this Heresie, Infants are not borne with originall sin, experience taught them that many of them dyed before they were in a capacity to commit actuall sin.

<pb n="220" facs="tcp:118911:119"/>of our Saviour for our sins, and the reason is, death is not a punishment, say they, for if it be a punishment, it must be a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment of sins; if so, then because Christ had no sins of his owne, it must be for the sins of others, and by consequent, his death must be satisfactory.</p>
                  <p>This is the Catholick Faith, that as in <hi>Adams</hi> standing in grace, all Mankind in his loins stood; so in his fall all his posterity fell with him: all our estates (as Mr. <hi>Sheppard</hi> saith) were ventured in this Ship, therefore if we will pertake of his gaine, if we had not made shipwrack of his graces, 'tis but equal we should partake of his losses too: <hi>In Adam we all sinned</hi> saith S. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>and by his sin Death entred into the World: Adam</hi> was the Head of all Mankinde, and all his posterity are naturally Members of that Head; if the Head plots Treason against a State, the whole Body is found guilty, and the who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I grant, a few small sparks of grace may make a good satisfaction to an indulgent Father, for the great offences of his Son, but he is a graceless childe that will misconstrue his Fathers good nature and actions, as to judge a few tears a full ransome for great offences: the Lord our God being not only a mercifull Father, but a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judge, requires not only a satisfaction of complacency, or an interpretative compensation founded on divine favour, but a satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of condignity, or a full and compleat payment for the debt of sinners; but where is this righteousness to be found? surely not in a bare creature, for how should a finite Good cover an infinite Evil, is not this too short a garment which will not cover halfe the body? is not this a plaister too narrow for the wound? and how should the best men which were poor themselves make others rich? how should they which needed righteousness themselves, impart their righteousness to make others righteous? the only means then to make an attonement for us, is the Lord our Righteousness. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. <hi>Et sic Deus justitiam exequendo misericordiam non evacuat, &amp; misericordiam exercendo justitiae suae nihil demit:</hi> and so to God being infinitely just; Christ being infinitely good, hath satisfied for man being in a sort infinitely sinfull: Christ hath paid a price of ransom, and a price of purchase, to merit Heaven for us, by standing in the roome of the Elect as their Surety, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 7.22. 2.

Where is such a saying to be found? The Law requires, that he who sustains the person of a sinner, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be separated from the Judge or not, satisfies the Law, and consequently the Judge. God the Son our mediatour can satisfie God our Father, and when God the Father is satisfied, God the Son and God the Holy Ghost are satisfied also, and he in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son satisfied Divine Justice, which is common to the Trinity, and therefore in our assumed nature, as he is our Mediatour, he satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fles himsel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The words of this Article, contain no new thing, but what hath been often mentioned by the Adversary, yet the fraud is to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered: he labours to conceal the horridnesse of his Tenet, by calling Christ our God, and this is, as it were a bait, whereby he would allure the unwary Reader, to swallow it down, that he might prevail with his pernicious hook.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we do not deny, but both to our singular comfort, and exceeding great profit, do heartily acknowledge, that the Son of God in our nature is exalted in power, honour and Dignity, far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove men and Angels, yea and the highest pitch of Majesty, that any creature is capable of.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Yet in the third place this concession will be no advantage to the Adversary for besides all that he hath spoken of Christ in that nature, our Saviour hath the same Divine nature with the Father, and he is the same God, though not the same person, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he doth infinitely abase him, by making him onely a creature God, and if he should strip him of all Soveraignty over us, and worship due thereto, yea, and esteem him in feriour to a worm he could not so much dishonour him, as he hath done in denying his Divinity, for the distance of one creature compared to another is but finite, but that which is betwixt God and the most eminent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is infinite, and Christ being the most high God, is not in that regard subordinate to his Father, but co-ordinate with him, for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate causes are not in the same order of causality, as if one of them be particular, the other is universall; if one be the first cause, the other is the second; if one of them be the principal cause, the other is an instrument or lesse principal, which have no place in the persons of the holy Trinity.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, albeit some eminent creatures, or which are taken to be such, may in diverse respects be called <hi>Elohim,</hi> yet is it not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Scripture- phrase not to the analogy of Faith to call that Creature our God, or my God.</p>

                  <p>In the first Text, <hi>John</hi> 20.17. our blessed Saviour contents not himselfe by saying <hi>God,</hi> but he adds, <hi>my God, your Father, and your God,</hi> intimating hereby the near conjunction betwixt himselfe and the faithfull, in two respects: first, that as he is Gods Son, calling the first person our Father, and the Father of Christ: secondly, because he is our God and Creator, as he is of Christ, in regard of his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; Christ as he was God simply, had not a God, but as Son he had a Father; but being both God and Man in regard of his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature he hath a God, and yet is God, as somethings belong to a Person in regard of a part, as man is mortal, though his soule is immortal: now as God is the God and Father of Christ, and of his servants in the fore-mentioned respect, yet in a different manner, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuated, in that Christ saith not, I ascend to our Father, and to our God, but to my Father, and your Father, to shew a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt his Son ship and ours, betwixt his creation and ours, that he is in a more excellent manner his Father then ours, and therefore first he saith, my Father, and then your Father. This is denoted by the Article prefixed before the one, &amp; not the other, God is not therfore the Father of Christ because he is our Father, but he is therefore our Father because he is his Father. We are Gods Sons onely by the grace of adoption, whereas Christ was not made the Son of God, but he was born the onely begotten Son of God, and touching his Humane Nature, he was conceived by the Holy Ghost, and that flesh was singularly united to the word by hypostatical union. Secondly in that notion, he was created in a more excellent manner then we are, but Christ as the Words not only created, but assumed that Nature into the unity of his person, and so may in a good sence be said to create himself, <hi>viz.</hi> touching his Humane Nature, but who can say that he created himselfe, save Christ only? and there is yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther difference, Christ was created without mans seed, he had no

                  <p>In a word, God in this Scripture is not taken essentially for one that governs all with supream dominion, but personally, which in the intrinsecall conception doth denote an intrinsecal relation in the most simple unity of the Godhead, its taken for the Father, the first Person of the sacred Trinity, as the inspection of the Text evinceth, and from hence you may conclude a distinction betwixt the divine Persons, that the Son of God is not the Father, but you cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer that he is not God; but the contrary rather, because he in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature ascended into Heaven by his own omnipotent power.</p>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:118911:128"/>Divine Nature, he neither was nor could be a Priest.</p>
                  <p>How then is it said, that Christ was without.

                  <p>To that place out of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> I answer, first according to the Adversaries supposition, that Christ could no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Adversary is very confident, that his Argument cannot be eluded, or rather the vanity thereof detected, because God the Father (as he takes for granted) is onely the most high God, and Christ then must needs be subordinate to him, but this is in truth a plain dotage, to say the Son is in a lesse perfect manner God, then the Father, because he hath a God; it is true, God creates, preserves, and governs all and all the made gods, who have truly a God above them, are under him, but the Son, as he is simply the Son of God, is co-equall and co-essentiall with his Father, even Jehovah himself, the great and the most high God, albeit the same person, in regard of his humane nature, is inferiour, and subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to him, and albeit Christ is not the Person, which is in many places called God. yet is he the same God, <hi>John</hi> 1.1. the highest God is understood, yet is not every one perfect, that is, the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est God understood thereby, and as in some places, the Son is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from God, so be there other places wherein the Father is distinguished from God <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.7. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.8 yea, and from Jehovah, for according to the Adversaries, the angels are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times called Jehovah. Shall we from hence conclude, that onely cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Angels are Jehovah.</p>
                  <p>Bid. <hi>For the further cleering of this matter, I will here exactly unfold the appellation of God, as I find it delineated in Scriptures, for many being ignorant hereof, hold very great and inexplicable errors, touching the Godhead of Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>First therefore the appellation of God denoteth him that hath a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural substance as</hi> Esa 31.3. The Aegyptians are Men, &amp; not God, Ezech. 28.2.9. Because thy heare is lifted up, and thou (<hi>Prince of</hi> Tyrus) hast said, I am god, yet thou art a man and not God: <hi>which werds do plainly intimate, that by God is meant a supernaturall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that cannot die, whereas every natural substance may die: thus is the Lord called God, and the Angels, because they are immortall.</hi>

                  <p>What singular thing you have performed in your delineation of the several ways how God is taken, will in part, by the sequel be discovered, and albeit you preferred exactnesse in this search of Scripture, yet is not your enumeration full, there are some other expressions, besides those here specified, which belong to Christ, and which cannot appertain to a creature-God; but whether the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of others, (thus doth he speak of our most eminent Divines, to whom others of meaner parts are but Scholars) in this poynt produceth strange errors touching the Deity of our Saviour, or your own prejudicate blindnesse in the mis-application of them is to be tried by the unerring testimony of the holy Ghost speaking in the Scriptures.</p>
                  <p>The first way is not generally true, for the soul of man is in some sense a supernatural living substance, which cannot be slain, and yet is never in Scripture language called god, and Divels which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not die are indeed called the gods of this world.</p>
                  <p>Was ever any one of our Writers ignorant of this deep mystery discovered by you, that God is taken for a supernatural living sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance that cannot die, and could our blessed Saviour in his Divine Nature die? we would forthwith and that most justly disclaime his Divinity How this can consist with your Exposition of Scripture and judgement, that Christ when he was God by his power to work miracles, and yet even then was subject to death, and at length crucified, I leave to your better thoughts.</p>

Let the Lord, the God of the Spirits of all flesh, set a man over this Congregation: <hi>therefore called the God of the Spirits of men, because he ruleth over them, but such rule and dominion is more then naturall, for they that exercise a natural or civil dominion have power over the flesh only, hence</hi> Paul <hi>saith</hi> Ephes. 6 5.

                  <p>For substance nothing is in all these Scriptures presented to our view by the Adversiry which is not obvious and assented to, onely some expressions are to be rectified.</p>
                  <p>First in that he saith, <hi>Gods dominion over the Angels is not natural,</hi> which in propriety of speech is very erroneous; the highest crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are subject to the natural Kingdome or rule of God, as to their Creator, and it is as natural for the God of Spirits, being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self an infinite all-knowing Spirit, to rule over all created Spirits, as for a mortal man to rule over Man who is mortal, yea and much more fully then so: it is true, Gods Rule is not properly civil, as that is of man which is over the flesh and body directly, but more glorious and Divine, for God hath absolute, and uncontrolled au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and soveraignty over all the creatures in the world.</p>

                     </gap>d, <hi>The spirits which are the subjects of this dominion are supernaturall.</hi> This in a good sense is not strange and no marvel, if Angels are called supernatural, for the same attribute is veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of all other creatures, they have their being not from Nature
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:118911:130"/>simply, but from the omnipotent will of the most high God. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gath, all creatures may in another sense be called naturall, as having their being and subsistence from the great God, who is, <hi>Natura Naturans:</hi> the usuall distinction of natural and supernatural is not in regard of substance: a thing is not called supernatural, but in regard of the accidental <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Scriptures alledged <hi>Psal.</hi> 97.7. and applied to Christ. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. that all the Angels are commanded to worship him is a very strong proofe of his Deity, in that he is worshipped with religious adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereof a creature, whose wisdome and power is but finite, is not capable, and well have the ancient Fathers judged the <hi>Arians</hi> to be Idolaters, and so have some <hi>Socinians</hi> censured their fellowes for worshipping Christ with religious worship, and yet do maintain that he is but a Creature, a created God.</p>
                  <p>Your other place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Thou hast made him a little lower,</hi> understand it lower for a short time, and that not simply neither, but because he humbled himselfe, as he was a man, to death, but all the Angels are immortal substances; for this speech being compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, extends only to that particular wherein holy Jesus and the Angels are compared together; as Angels are in many respects more excellent then men, yet men have some perfections agreeable to their state, which Angels want, for instance <hi>vis productiva prolis Scotis in</hi> 4. <hi>Sentent. dis</hi> 49. So albeit Christ was in regard of his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion lower then the Angels, yet as he was the Son of God, and had the Humane Nature hypostatically united to the Person of the Son of God, and as it was enriched with supernaturall gifts above measure, he was thus above Angels, and who was no doubt in the state of his infirmity and in the days of his flesh, as the Apostle speaketh, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipped by the holy Angels.</p>

                  <p>All this is spoken to blear the eyes of the Reader, and 'tis nothing but sophisticall juggling, he saith, Christ is true God, but he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, that he is the eternal and omnipotent God.</p>
                  <p>All the particulars are absolutely true of him, as he is God, but in an improper and limited sense, as he is man.</p>
                  <p>The Dominion of Christ over all, both naturall as he is God, and do native conferred on him, as he is our Mediatour in time, we do to our great comfort acknowledge, as also that he bestows spirituall blessings, yea, the Holy Ghost in the Scripture sense, and eternall life, grace and peace, and glory are from him, as he is God, and as he is Mediatour, both God and man, and that is done <hi>dispositivè,</hi> or <hi>per modum praeparantis,</hi> by preparing and fitting men for grace by his passion, satisfying Gods wrath, removing all matter of dislike, meriting the favour and acceptation of God for us, which depened upon the excellency of his person, and on the Divine Nature which
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:118911:132"/>made his passion meritorious for us; Christ is also the soveraigne Author of grace effective, <hi>per modum impertientis,</hi> by way of efficacy conferring to us grace by the operation of his Holy Spirit; for he alone enlightens the dark understandings of men, he alone softens their hard hearts, and sanctifies their disordered affections, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formes the whole man.</p>
                  <p>But this Antitrinitarian albeit he cals Christ a true God, yet doth not the definition of God in his sense belong to him, for he will in no case say, he is a spiritual eternal essence infinite in all perfections.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there is a wide difference betwixt these two to be called a God, as sometimes in holy Scriptures some creatures are, and to be a God in reality.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, all or most of the former particulars do not demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively prove, that those to whom they are attributed are truly God, but there is further required the Divine Nature and omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency, <hi>Jerem</hi> 10.11. if he be God, he hath made Heaven and Earth, as Christ indeed is the Author of these great Works; besides it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver said, which is carefully to be observed, that Christ in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phrase is a made God, but he was even in the depth and lowest degree of his humiliation called, and that most truly as he was God, and our God.</p>

                  <p>All this we do heartily imbrace, and willingly subscribe unto, but these passages are not in the least to the prejudice of our cause, but do make much for us, and do afford a double Argument to prove the property, so called Deity of Gods Son.</p>
                  <p>First, because he wrought miracles by his owne power, for God alone is the soveraign Author of miraculous works, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.18. and our Saviour argueth from his works, and proves his equality with the Father, <hi>John</hi> 5.18. which the Jewes charged on him to be no less
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:118911:133"/>a sin then blasphemy, and in the next verse he saith, <hi>Whatsoever things the Father doth, the very same doth the Son likewise:</hi> that is, by the sameness of his essence, and most perfect equality with the Father; and we may take notice how both Natures of our Saviour concurred in his miraculous works very frequently, in his Humane Nature he received power in time, but in his Divine Nature he had power eternally in himselfe to work them, as he was God he ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the eyes of the blind, as he was man, he touched sometimes the ill affected member; as he was man he touched the Leper, as he was God, he said, <hi>I will, be thou clean, and the Leprous was cleansed Mat.</hi> 8.3. as he was man he looked up to Heaven and sighed, and put his fingers into the ears of a deaf man, he spit and touched his tongue, as he was God he said (with authority) <hi>Ephphatha, be thou opened,</hi> and immeditely he had the use of his ears and of his tongue, <hi>Mar.</hi> 37.33.34. as he was man, he wept, he sighed, thanked God, and spoke to dead <hi>Lazarus, Come forth,</hi> as he was God, he raised him from the dead, <hi>John</hi> 11.43. When we see a candle shine through the horns of a Lanthorn, we do not fix our mindes on the Lanthorn, which hath no native vertue thus to shine, but on the Candle it selfe, which sends forth thorough its radiant light; in like manner when we do contemplate the glorious works which our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentally wrought by his humane Nature, we must not rest in the meditation of the visible creature, but by it transmit our mindes to the invisible God, who was the proper and principal cause of them.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our Saviour had not only power to work miracles him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but he gave power and authority to whom and when he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to work them in his name, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.12.16.38. this is so transcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent a favour, that no Apostle nor any creature can give to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but it is an honour which is peculiarly reserved in the hands of supream Majesty, and it was a palpable error in <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and so it is in any other man to think otherwise, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.19.</p>
                  <p>It was the infirmity of <hi>John,</hi> a beloved Apostle to be envious that any one which was not a professed Disciple should have the gift of working miracles in the Name of Christ, herein he was not unlike to <hi>Josuah, Numb.</hi> 11.18. which was troubled that <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dad</hi> prophesied in their tents, and Jesus in effect answered him as, <hi>Moses</hi> did his servant, let as many as wil cast out Divels in my Name, though they keep not company with us, no man is so foolishly vain;
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:118911:133"/>that will at the same time both make use of and blaspheme my Name, <hi>He that is a Souldier and fights not against me</hi> (according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb) <hi>he is for me, in that he makes use of my Name for such a purpose,</hi> according to that famous speech of <hi>Caius Caesar, Grotius in hom:</hi> yea, our blessed Saviour confers this great gift (such was his bounty) not only on him which was not then a professed Disciple, but on the Reprobates which at the last day will plead for themselves, that they had in the Name of Christ cast out Divels, to whom Christ will an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <hi>Depart ye wicked, I know you not:</hi> verily this makes much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst, but nothing at all for the Adversary.</p>

                  <p>There is I grant, a difference betwixt the second and third Person of the holy Trinity in working miracles. For the Holy Ghost was not incarnated, as was the Son of God, and both Natures as I have shewed, concurred, although in a different manner in their produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction very frequently: as also in the order of working, which agrees to the order of subsisting, as the Divine Nature with all essentiall properties were communicated to the Holy Ghost, by the Father and Son of God, not as two Agents but as one principle, so doth the Son work by the Holy Ghost: this granted, yet the vertue and power conferred on the Apostles and others in those dayes, whereby they cured diseases without Physick, yea and inflicted formidable Judgments as <hi>Paul</hi> on <hi>Elymas,</hi> yea death it selfe as <hi>Peter</hi> did on <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphirah</hi> his Wife, and whereby they cast out Divels in the name of Jesus Christ was one and the same power in the Son and Holy Ghost, that is, a Divine Power, for ability to work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles is proper to God, and so doth equally belong to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:118911:134"/>God the Son and God the Holy Ghost, and that we might not doubt hereof the Holy Ghost in the Text 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. is declared to be an absolute Author of such gifts, and bestows them where and how, and to whom he pleaseth, nor is there the least superiority discovered in the diversity of operations ascribed to God the Father, and in the diversity of gifts ascribed to God the Holy Ghost, and of administrations to the Lord; is not the Spirit made the absolute Authour of gifts, and the Son of administrations, as God is of operations? shall we say that the Spirit is not so the Author of gifts, as God is the Author of them? to be Author of gifts and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations imports it not equal glory as to be Author of operations? operation proceeds from administration, and administration depends on gifts! what preheminence hath the Father in that tis said, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>It is confessed that the Disciples are not said to cast out Divels in the name of the Holy Ghost, as they did expresly in the name of Jesus Christ, yet did they in very truth cast them out in his name; for what is it to cast out Divels in the name of the Holy Ghost? is it not to do it by his power, and by a gift received from him? this they received, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. as the text proveth; for how else I pray you, could the Holy Ghost give this to others? and not only did the Apostles, but Christ himselfe also as he was man cast out Divels in the Name of the Holy Ghost, for he did then by the finger of God, 12. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. besides there was an evident reason why the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles should make an open profession that they cast out Divels in the Name of Christ, not only to renounce thereby all honour and glory as due to themselves by such eminent works, as they were instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to produce, but to advance the honour of Christ, obscured and vailed by his sufferings in the flesh, he was a person contemned and slighted by the Jews and Gentiles, now this seasonable profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssion of the Apostles, that all they did in that kind was by the name of Jesus, was a notable demonstration of the glory of the Son of God, whom the Jews had crucified.</p>

                  <p>This place hath been already examined page 266. and these that follow, and I purpose not largely, <hi>actum agere,</hi> and to roll the same stone, in that holy Text, our Saviour is described, both as he is the Son of God simply, and likewise in regard of his offices, and the benefits which do flow from that fountain to us. In the first Consideration, he is stiled the mighty God, a Title too high and lofty for any creature, and which can fitly appertain to none but the most high God, nor will this sacred Scripture evince, that Christ is made a mighty God by the bounty and favour of the Lord of hosts, as you do most unworthily confound things that do differ, for I demand, what is that the Lord of hosts will perform, is it to make Christ really to be almighty God? Surely not this by any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Deduction, but by a forced Interpretation without any foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the Text, what then? he shall have the Throne of <hi>David,</hi> (who is a mighty God touching his person) he shall order and sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish it in Justice, from hence forth for ever, <hi>the zeal of the Lord of Hosts will perform this:</hi> now the Distinction betwixt the Lord of Hosts giving a Throne, and the promised Messias to whom it is given, is not denied, but unanimously acknowledged by us, for who is so rude to confound the Lord of Hosts, the eternal God with the humane nature of our Saviour, or with the Mediatour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man? and we are sure by the Testimony of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.

The Lord God of hostes was with <hi>David: Wherefore the aforesaid passage to the Romanes doth not shew that Christ is the most high God; but rather the contrary, in that he is so a God over all, as that he himselfe in the mean time hath a God, for that he is not a God over all, none excepted, is apparent, for then he would be a God over the Father, which every one will confess to be most false.</hi>

                  <p>You discover to us a great mystery to no purpose, and an obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, which, as I conceive, is not taken notice of, either by the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient or modern Writers, whose knowledge surely was not below Mr. <hi>Biddles</hi> in Criticism, and if in one place the name God is sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, which is your only proofe; Doth it follow that it is always to be understood in a hundred? and why may not the name God be proper to the great God, as it is in other places, you do not demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate: I am to learn how this which you here say can either hurt us, or advantage you; it had been well for you, if you had had lesse of the Grammarian, if you had had more of the sober and learned Divine.</p>
                  <p>It is true that Christ is so God over all, that he himselfe hath a God, I mean the Father distinguished from him; yet will it not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, because he hath a Father which is God over all, that therefore the Son is not God over all for this is an honor necessarily annexed to the Deity to be over all, and by consequent, which is contrary to
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:118911:136"/>the Adversaries collection, this is a title which doth equally belong to God the Father and God the Son.</p>
                  <p>You do object, that the title cannot be taken without exception, for then Christ should be over God the Father also: the answer is easie: this Elogy is not ascribed to him to exalt him above the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but above all creatures, as it appeareth by 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.27. all things are put under the feet of Christ, but God the Father is excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that put all things under his feet, and you also do attest, that he is according to the Scripture, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.20 above all creatures, the highest of them all both men and Angels.</p>
                  <p>This Text hath invincible proofs of the Deity of the Son of God, in that his office is not described, nor is he above all by a gift con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on him in time by his Father, but by nature and eternal ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</p>
                  <p>First, because he is said to be of the Jews according to the flesh, which is spoken by way of limitation, more then intimating thereby that he hath not only a Humane Nature, but the Divine, which is not of the Fathers, for flesh is frequently taken for man, <hi>Luk.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Math.</hi> 24.22. 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.24. yea, as it refers to Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. he was of the seed of <hi>David</hi> according to the flesh, as other children are of the seed of their Parents: now Philosophy teacheth us that it is the man, the <hi>totum</hi> that is generated, and not the body only with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out their souls. <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.35.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, this is evinced by the description of Christ, that he is <hi>God over all blessed for ever,</hi> which cannot appertain to any but to the most high God: whosoever is a God over all blessed for ever, he is the true and the eternal God; there are Synonymies, as <hi>homo</hi> and <hi>animal rationale,</hi> it is a reasonable animal: <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is a man, and as evident reason, so the words of the Apostle do prove it, <hi>Rom</hi> 1.25. What is ascribed in one place to the Creator of all things, that in the other is ascribed to the Son of God: it was a custome solemnly observed by the Jewes, when ever the Priests in the Sanctuary spoke of the Name of God, the people used some words of blessing or praising God, which forms were after added <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>What the Spirit of holinesse is, will be no hard matter to find out, if we consider, that as the flesh signifieth a constituting part of Christ, namely the fleshy body, so also must the Spirit of holinesse opposed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, signifie a constituting part; if so, then it is not the holy Spirit, as every one will confesse, nor the resonable soul of Christ, because he is intimated to have had this Spirit by the means of the Resurrection from the dead, nor the Divine Nature, for that is no where designed in the Scripture by the name of Spirit, or Spirit of holinesse: Besides the Adversaries hold, that Christ had the Divine Nature, whilst he was yet cloathed with flesh, it remains therefore that by the Spirit of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is to be understood his holy spirituall body, which Christ had by means of the Resurrection from the dead, which is a constituting part of him, whereby he is excepted from all other men, being the first born from the dead, or the first that rose from death, so as he never died again, but was clothed with a spiritual body, and made like to God, who is a Spirit.</hi>

                  <p>Secondly, our Translation runs thus, declared to be Gods Son, you say, which I omitted in setting down your words in the former Section, in Greek, determined, or ordained, the word is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> is a definition. The former sense doth not belong to this place as the Context sheweth, for Christ is not predestinated to be the Son of God in that consideration the Apostle describes him, <hi>v.</hi> 4. he was the Son of God before the Resurrection, therefore by the Resurrection he could not be constituted Gods Son, but hereby it was evidently shewed and declared to us, that he was the Son of God, Our Translation is both agreeable to the originall, and takes away the ambiguity, which is left as doubtfull by the other: now to the matter it self.</p>
                  <p>By the Flesh is not meant the fleshy body onely of our Saviour, as it is distinguished from his soul, but his humane nature consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both of a fleshy body and a reasonable soul by an usual <hi>Synech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doche, i.e.</hi> Christ according to his humane nature, or as he was a man, was born a Jew of the stock of <hi>David,</hi> and his being according to the flesh, is opposed to the Spirit of holinesse, that is, to the other nature in him, and is called the Eternall Spirit, which did shine
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:118911:138"/>forth most brightly in him, after and through his resurrection from the dead: this Nature then had a real existence before his incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for it was such a modified nature that could have taken on him the seed of Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. but, would not do so, but was the Son of <hi>Abraham. Theodoret Dialog.</hi> 1. saith, As often as I speak of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of a known and an ordinary man, I do not say, he is the Son of such a man according to the flesh; but I do simply say, he is the Son of such a one, as <hi>Abraham</hi> begat <hi>Isaac,</hi> I adde not, according to the flesh, because he had no other Nature but the Humane, but I speak otherwise of Christ, because he had not onely the Humane, but Divine Nature.</p>
                  <p>As it is said here that Christ was made or born after the flesh, so in other Scriptures the Son of Man is said to come from Heaven, and to be in Heaven in respect of his Deity, when he was on earth, 3. <hi>Joh.</hi> 13. this place then is not serviceable for the Adversary, for he was Gods Son by eternal generation, and he by the Spirit of holinesse was made the Son of Man by his incarnation, and clearly manifested to his Disciples to be so by his powerfull resurrection. The words then hold forth a cōmunication of properties, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of Christ in respect of his Divine Nature, is attributed to the Humane Nature, he was made of the seed of <hi>David;</hi> the same Person is called <hi>The Son of God</hi> in respect of his Deity, and <hi>The Son of Man,</hi> or of the seed of <hi>David,</hi> in respect of his humanity; the whole person is incarnated, but not the whole of the Person, but only in regard of his humane Nature.</p>
                  <p>I do confesse that by the Spirit of holinesse is not meant the Holy Spirit, <hi>viz</hi> the third Person of the sacred Trinity, and your reason is good, because the scope of the Apostle is to describe the Person of our blessed Saviour, which is the foundation of that doctrine, which the Apostle intends to treat of, as in the former part hee describes his Humane Nature, so in the latter his Divine: I grant also that the soul of Christ is not meant by the Spirit of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, but your proof is faulty, for Christ has not this Spirit of holinesse, nor doth the Text say that he had it by his resurrection, but he had it before his death and resurrection, but he (that was before the Son of God) was declared with power, that is by that Spirit of holinesse, which manifested it selfe by raising Christ from the dead, for this is a work of omnipotency, without contra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>ction: there is then by the Spirit of sanctification a secret relation both to the flesh
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:118911:138"/>of Christ, and to the Church, his members and body, whereby they are all of them sanctified.</p>
                  <p>The Divine Nature (saith he) cannot be meant by the name of Spirit, because it is no where in Scripture designed by the name of Spirit: to this I answer, first this reason, if true, is no sufficient confutation, because possible a term may be but once used <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in that sense, however the Adversary confutes it himselfe, for where shall we find in Scripture, that by the Spirit of holinesse is meant a holy spiritual body?</p>
                  <p>Secondly I answer, that the term equivalently is in Scripture, <hi>God is a Spirit,</hi> or spirituall substance, <hi>John</hi> 4. and he is called the Spirit, as most fit to set out the opposition, because he had said in the former member, not according to man, but according to the flesh, he makes choice of a word directly opposite thereto, which shews the incomprehensible and ineffable vertue of the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>viz.</hi> Spirit and this Spirit is called the Spirit of holinesse from the effect, because he sanctified his owne humane Nature, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in which he dwelt, and which he assumed into the unity of his Divine Person, and by which he doth likewise sanctifie all the Elect which are the living Members of that body, whereof he is the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal head; this sense is made out by the opposition betwixt flesh and spirit, otherwise it would not have been full and intire, nor would it shew according to what he was, the seed of <hi>David,</hi> nor how he declared himselfe to be omnipotent by his resurrection from the dead, unlesse it had been wrought by his own Spirit, and albeit Christ is not said to do this, or shewes this in other Texts by the Spirit of holinesse, yet is it in holy Scriptures set down in terms equivalent, for he offered himselfe by his eternal Spirit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. which words S. <hi>Paul</hi> more sully explicateth, saying, <hi>He was crucified through weaknesse;</hi> that is, in his Humane Nature, yet <hi>he liveth by the power of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13 4. that is, he was raised again from death to life by his Divine power, as S. <hi>Bernard</hi> saith, misery belonged to the Humane Nature, but power to the Divine, <hi>Ser. de Verb. Sapient.</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18.19. the like opposition betwixt the flesh and the Spirit is in this text, he was put to death in the flesh, but was quickened by the Spirit, which as the following works do open, cannot be meant of his soul, which could not preach it, having no being in dayes of <hi>Noah,</hi> when the Spirit of Christ by <hi>Noah</hi> preached to the disobedient World: See this largely confirmed out of the Fathers
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:118911:139"/>by Mr. <hi>Parker, de Descensu Christi ad Inferos, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>S.</hi> 55. once more God was manifested in the flesh, justified by the Spirit, <hi>id est,</hi> declared to be just by the Deities raising him from the dead, by his aseention into Heaven, and sitting there at Gods right hand.</p>
                  <p>The second Argument to prove the Divine Nature cannot be meant, because he had it, as we confesse, whiles he was cloathed with flesh.</p>
                  <p>True, but what of that? the adversary supposeth that to be true which is manifestly false, and a corruption of the Text, that Christ had not the Spirit of holinesse till after his resurrection. Observe these termes are not equivalent, to have a thing is one thing and to prove that a man hath it by a glorious effect is another thing: a Child hath a reasonable soul, who can deny it? but this is manifested to others when he acts rationally: in the Mothers womb its male or female, but not declared the one or other but by its nativity. I adde, that the Adversary doth more then intimate, that Christ is not now cloathed with the flesh, what then shall become of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection of the body? for what is resurrection but the raising up of the same body which was dead, we must distinguish betwixt the nature of a true humane body, which Christ now hath in glory, and betwixt the frail and corruptible qualities thereof, which cannot enter into Heaven.</p>
                  <p>After the Adversary had removed all false interpretations of the Spirit of holinesse, as he apprehended them, he sets downe his owne judgement, that it is his holy spiritual body, which dies no more. but tis like God who is a Spirit.</p>
                  <p>May not a man justly wonder at the forgetfulnesse or folly of the Adversary, that he endeavours to confute our sense of the Spirit of holinesse, because the Deity is never in Scripture called the Spirit of holinesse, and tels us that thereby is meant a holy spiritual body, and yet neither doth nor can alledge one Scripture to that pupose, nor any Expositor old or modern, excepting <hi>Socinians,</hi> which say that a glorified or spiritual body is called, <hi>The Spirit of holinesse?</hi> nor will the words of the text bear this corrupt glosse, for to be made of the Seed of <hi>David</hi> according to the flesh, implies a limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and distinction, and doth shew that the same Perso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The Adversary with the <hi>Photinians</hi> holds a grosse opinion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:118911:139"/>the body of Christ raised from the dead, calling it a holy spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall body, and they doe deny the resurrection of the same body, and that other bodies which are eternal and spiritual, shall be given to us.</p>
                  <p>First, this is to deny the Resurrection, for to rise againe is not to exist again; as sight restored to a blind man, is not resurrection of sight; and the restoring of health to a sickly man, is not a resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of health, but 'tis an Article to believe the resurrection of the same body.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in what body Christ rose from death, in that he is in Heaven, for he rose again not to live on Earth, but in Heaven, yea, and he hath a Humane body in Heaven, <hi>Math.</hi> 25.31. how else can he be called the Son of man, if he hath not a humane body? and what other thing is mans body, but flesh and bloud? and the bodily members, as Face, Eyes, Hands, Feet, and the rest do beautifie, and perfect the body, without these the body is imperfect.</p>
                  <p>Christ rose from the dead with flesh, and said to his Disciples when they were troubled, <hi>Behold my hands and my feet, a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see I have, Luk.</hi> 24.39 and to confirm <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> in the faith of his Resurrection, <hi>Reach hither thy finger, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold my hands, and reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side, John</hi> 20.27. <hi>He did eat and drinke with the Disciples after the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and was seen alive after his Passion forty dayes;</hi> and in the same continued narration, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.2, 3, 9.11. 'tis spoken of one and the same humane body, <hi>He was taken up into Heaven in the same body, and the same Jesus shall so come from Heaven, as the Disciples saw him go into Heaven.</hi> And <hi>Act.</hi> 2 30 <hi>He was raised so from the dead that his body saw no corruption.</hi> 31. and <hi>He was seen of</hi> Stephen <hi>in Heaven, Act.</hi> 7. and <hi>They shall look on him whom they have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, Revel.</hi> 1.7. and to alledge no more Scriptures, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6 9.10. <hi>Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more:</hi> how could he say so, if he had a really distinct body from that in which he was raised? for the body of a man, as it is a body, riseth not again, because as it is a body, it dieth not, for so the Elements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> being bodies should die; but it dieth as it is a living body consisting of flesh and bloud, for death is onely where life was, and that which dieth is raised up again.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, if Christ hath not flesh in Heaven, neither shall his Members, the faithfull; for our bodies must be conformable to the
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:118911:140"/>glorious body of Christ, but we shall have the same bodies for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in Heaven which we have on Earth, for the Apostle saith 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.53, 54. <hi>This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortality must put on immortality:</hi> the context proves that the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is Man consisting of a body or reasonable soule; there is iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of the same subject in this life, and the life to come; <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Paraeus in locum,</hi> but they hit not on your strange Exposition, that by eternal spirit a spirituall body is meant, which no where in Scripture, I am sure, is called an Eternal spirit: the body indeed is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Saint <hi>Paul</hi> after the Resurrection, a Spiritual body, but it is never called a Spirit. Will you say, that Christs glorified body in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is made of aire, or a heavenly substance? and how should that body offer it self to God? much more rationally might you have said with some of ours, that by Eternal Spirit is meant the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and immortall soul, intimating thereby, that he knowingly and willingly in obedience to his Father, suffered death for us: but this is rather to be understood, as most commonly it is by ancient Fathers, and later Writers, of his Divine natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e which made his bloudy sacrifice on the Crosse, acceptable to God, and able to purge us from dead works, that is, from sins which deserve death; for the dignity of his worthy sacrifice ariseth not from the blood, or soul of man, though it be more excellent than the bloud of Bulls and goats, but from the invaluable worth of the person, whose blood was sacrificed: no satisfaction of a creature can take away sinne, which hath a kind of infinity, in that it is committed against an infinite person, <hi>Aquin. Sum. par.</hi> 3. <hi>q.</hi> 1 <hi>art</hi> 2. no finite sum can discharge an infinite debt; the nature and worth of a holy man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing finite, is as far from infinitnesse (be it what it will be in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison of other finite things) as nothing at all is from all, or as that which is from that which is not. This then affords an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove, that Christ was not onely man, but the true and Eternal God, for by his Spirit, his own Eternal Spirit, he offered himself to God, and the holy Apostles make a clear difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the flesh which was offered, and the Spirit, which at the same time offered it, and by consequence Christ is a Priest, not onely according to the humane, but the Divine Nature also, for being a Priest, he offered his flesh and blood as man, but the worth and efficacy of his bitter passion flowed from his Eternall Spirit, that is,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:118911:141"/>his Divine nature, as the principle thereof, the Eternal Spirit of our Saviour procured that his Passion should work an Eternall Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and purgation of our sinnes.</p>
                  <p>You adde out of the fifth to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> that flesh and spirit are opposed, as Eternity is to dayes: this we grant to be true, but it is to be observed that the opposition is to be taken in regard of the same time: in this manner he offered (and sacrificed) by his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal spirit, which he then had, and not onely after, as you say, when he had been crucified. Besides, doth this opposition betwixt flesh and Spirit, prove at all, that an immortall glorified body is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the eternall spirit: verily, if there was nothing else eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall but a glorified body, the point had been fully proved, but sith this is attributed not onely to Angels their souls now, and bodies after the Resurrection.

                  <p>Batts and owls may conceive and pretend, that they can see further with their weak eyes and dimme sight, than the quick-sighted Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles can discern. The deep speculation of this Seraphicall and illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated Doctour is this; Christ made his offering for our sinnes in heaven, and not on the Crosse: this Divinity is strange in the ears of our people, and directly contrary to the holy Scriptures, the rule of our faith, if we will speak as the Apostle doth in that Text of his expiatory and satisfactory oblation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Christ was a common person, no otherwise then the first <hi>Adam</hi> was, who is called the figure of Christ, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. and Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self is called the second <hi>Adam,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. as sinne and death is from the one, so is righteousnesse and life from the other, and this is effected by his oblation, whereby he undertook as a surety to pay our debts, and satisfie divine Justice, by undergoing the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:118911:142"/>due to our sins, and this was done by his bloudy death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.28. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.25. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. and by many other Texts to this purpose not needfull to be named. <hi>Augustin. in Psal.</hi> 37. saith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly, that Christ sustained the Person of the first <hi>Adam</hi> on his Crosse, and <hi>Theodoret. Dialog.</hi> 3. compares the first and second <hi>Adam</hi> together, as the Physick with the Disease, as the Plaister with the Wound, Righteousness with Sin, Blessing with Cursing, Forgivenes with Condemnation, Observation of the Law with the Transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of it, as Life with Death, and Heaven with Hell, Christ with <hi>Adam,</hi> and Man with Man.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, our Saviour himselfe said <hi>John</hi> 19 30. when he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting out of this life, <hi>It is finished,</hi> and bowing downe his head a gesture of Prayer, he said, <hi>Father into thy hands</hi> I <hi>commit my Spirit, and gave up the Ghost:</hi> our Redemption according to the Oracles of the Prophets was now wrought, and what was signified by legal types, which were shaddows of good things to come, was then ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complished, and the Sun of righteousness being risen, these shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and dark resemblances of good things to come by Christ are vanished.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly I add, that Christ acted as a Priest, whiles he was on earth, for he taught the heavenly Doctrine, he prayed, he blessed, he offered up himselfe, he purged us from our sins, and then he sat in Heavenly places, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.3. he offered up prayers with strong cries, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.7. plainly relating to his bitter agony in his passion, and if you please to penetrate into that divine Epistle, there are convincing proofes to manifest this truth, <hi>chap.</hi> 9. <hi>v.</hi> 13. Christ sacrificed neither by the bloud of Buls and Goats, but by his own bloud he entred in once into the holy place (Heaven) having obtained eternal redemption for us, and not for a time onely, as were the legal justifications by types, but this Redemption shall continue to the end of the World, and the efficacy thereof reached backward even to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.11. the faithfull all of them make but one Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church, and are all of them saved by him and by no other: now this Redemption is not purchased without shedding of bloud, which was done on Earth, and not in Heaven, and <hi>vers.</hi> 15. 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly said, that by the death of the Mediator, the truly reformed and penitent have the redemption of their transgressions, and the expiation of their sins, and this the Apostle proves, that his oblation was in his passion, because he could not die often, and therefore he
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:118911:142"/>could not be offered more then once, <hi>ver.</hi> 25, 26. this Argument of the Apostle would not be of any force, unlesse this be granted, he offered himselfe but once, therefore he could not die often, and <hi>v.</hi> 26. <hi>Once hath he appeared to put away sins,</hi>

                  <p>Fourthly, Gods Justice and his truth required that our sins were to be satisfied for by the death of the <hi>Messias,</hi> whereby God gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together in one all things both in Heaven and in Earth, <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.10. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Lastly, where there is properly no Altar, there is no sacrifice of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up to God; but in Heaven there is no Altar, as there was no Altar for burnt offering in the Sanctuary, but an Altar of Incense, which was not raised up for <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>To prosecute the comparison betwixt the Typicall and spirituall high Priest: as the high Priest went into the Sanctuary with some part of the blood of this Sacrifice, and sweet Incense beaten small, which prefigured the bitter agony and death of our Saviour; so Jesus Christ having made an atonement for us by his oblation and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, entred into the highest heavens, and remains there a Priest for ever to make intercession for us, not as in the dayes of his humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by vocall external prayers, nor by offering an externall sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for us, for our Redemption was purchased, and expiation was
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:118911:144"/>made before Christ entered into heaven, but by appearing in the presence of God, and to negotiate as the Priest did in the holy of holies, and on our behalf, and to relieve us in our wants, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. by the vigorous effect of his Sacrifice, once performed for us: if the blood of <hi>Abel</hi> unjustly shed cries for vengeance continually, how much more shall the blood of Christ shed but once for our sins, cry alwayes for mercy and reconciliation.</p>

                  <p>It is true, at that time Christ was visibly seen by <hi>Thomas,</hi> and from hence you argue he is not God, because God is invisible.

How can these jarring sentences be reconciled? very well: though faith may be of things which are seen by the eyes of the body, yet it doth not depend on them in that notion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, as they are so seen, but as they are seen with the eyes of the minde illustrated by the shining truth in the word. <hi>Lombar. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Dist.</hi> 24. <hi>cap.</hi> 3, the Apostle distinguisheth, <hi>We look on the things which are not seen:</hi> we look on them, and yet they are not seen by us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. and albeit God is said to be invisible in regard of his essence, yet it is said, that <hi>the time will come when we shall see God face to face,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. for as the great School-man <hi>Alexander Halensis</hi> saith, there are three degrees of knowledge of God in the understanding answerable to the three degrees of knowledge by our Senses, as we know sweetness: first, by hearing, Honey is sweet: to this a kind of faith is answerable; for <hi>faith comes by hearing:</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, by seeing sweet things: speculative knowledge in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing is correspondent to this: and thirdly, by tasting Honey to be sweet, experimental knowledge answereth to this: yea, as the Sun is seen divers wayes by the eyes of the body, so likewise is God by the eyes of the mind; sometimes through a clear bright Cloud, so is God seen by the Angels and glorified Saints: sometimes through a dark Cloud, thus God was seen by <hi>Adam</hi> in the state of innocency: sometimes through a compounded glasse whereby we see the image of the image: thus do we see Gods face now by faith in the glasse of the word: briefly, as the acts of the reasonable soule do discover that immortal substance, which cannot without absurdity be denied; so likewise, albeit God is in his essence invisible, yet by our Saviours works <hi>Thomas</hi> discovered him to be the most High God. <hi>Thomas</hi>

                  <p>The are many wayes how the word was in the beginning: in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of generation, as he is simply the Sonne of God: and in predestination, or preordination with God in promise: by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition or publick manifestation, or in regard of institution and sanctification of him to the office of a Mediatour. Beginning in respect of generation and preordination, belongs to Eternity; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of promise, to the beginning of fathers, man: beginning in respect of exhibition, to the manifestation of Christ in the flesh; in regard of declaration, to the beginning of his publick ministry: in regard of institution and sanctification of him to that sacred of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice was done by his Father, when the Holy Ghost descended on him at his Baptisme in the likenesse of a Dove, and when by his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers voice he was called to the publick office of a Mediatour.</p>
                  <p>These I will not insist on at present, many of them not agreeing to the beginning in Saint <hi>John,</hi> I will onely mention two, wherein both of them do thus far concur, that our Saviours eternal being, is signified thereby, though they differ much in the meaning of the word it self.</p>
                  <p>First, some will have beginning understood of the relation <hi>ad
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:118911:147"/>intra,</hi> that is, the word was in the Father who is <hi>principium ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginarium,</hi> this Exposition is for the matter true, for the Son is in the Father, but the word <hi>beginning</hi> is never so taken in Gods holy Oracles, and therefore not warrantable to give a strange sense to a word in this place, where no necessity infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth it.</p>
                  <p>Others by <hi>beginning</hi> do note eternity to be meant thereby, Our Apostle and Evangelist, like an Eagle, flies higher then the Creation, aymes at a higher beginning, lookes upon the Sun, and fastens his eyes on the eternal beginning of eternity; in this sense <hi>beginning</hi> seems to be taken, when our Saviour saith, <hi>he knew from the [beginning] who they were that believed not, John</hi> 6.64. now this he certainly knew from eternity, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is hid from him, who is the God everlasting, but all things are open in his sight, and the Apostle <hi>Paul, Coloss.</hi> 1.18. <hi>He is the Beginning,</hi> which is more fitly referred to our Saviour as he is our Mediator, but that place is evident <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.8. where he is called <hi>Alpha</hi> and <hi>Omega,</hi> the Beginning and the End: here the Lords everlasting being is described; <hi>beginning</hi> of it selfe doth not note eternity necessarily, yet the word <hi>End</hi> being added, it doth, and to put the matter out of doubt, the Apostle saith, that <hi>God from the beginning chose the Thessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians,</hi> 2 <hi>Thess.</hi> 2.13. what is <hi>from the beginning,</hi> but as the same Apostle speakes in like manner in another place, <hi>before the foundation of the World, Ephes.</hi> 1.4. and <hi>Origene</hi> saith, (of whom that is proverbially spoken; Where he spake well, none spake better) in the beginning of his Works the first of <hi>Genesis, In the beginning God created Heaven:</hi> what other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning is there of all things, but his Word? <hi>Our Lord by whom he made Heaven and Earth,</hi> as Saint <hi>John</hi> in the beginning of his Gospel saith, <hi>in the beginning was the Word.</hi> Thus <hi>Origen:</hi> this I confess is not a primary, and a proper Exposition of the Text, but a secondary, and no way convincing the Adversary, for if this had been the minde of the Holy Ghost, one would think that the words would have been thus, the Word was from eternity, rather then in eternity.</p>
                  <p>The second and common Exposition of the Orthodox is, that by <hi>beginning,</hi> is to be understood the beginning of those
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:118911:148"/>things which have a beginning, <hi>Principium principiatorum, viz.</hi> of those things which begin in time, and it notes out pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the first moment and point of time, when time, place, creation, and things created in time and place began to be, and herein our Evangelist in all probability hath relation to the first words of the first Chapter of <hi>Genesis, In the beginning God created Heaven and Earth:</hi> and <hi>Grotius</hi> saith, that so the <hi>Syriac</hi> hath it <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> expounds <hi>beginning</hi> not as I have done, nor as the old <hi>Arians, viz.</hi> of the Creation of the World, but of the beginning of the Gospel, and spiritual world, because the word is to be restrained to the matter in hand. This is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable Rule to which I do willingly subscribe, and I know it will not advantage his cause, but overthrow his Heretical Doctrine: <hi>Beginning,</hi> when it speaks of Time, signifies the beginning of time, or the world, unless the subject matter hindred, as here no circumstances shew it to be taken <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, but absolutely, and therefore is not to be restrained to the beginning of preaching the Gospel. It is a true Rule in Logick, <hi>Talia esse subjecta qualia permittuntur esse à Praedicatis suis commodè intellectis; &amp; vice versa, Talia esse praedicata qualia esse à subject is permittuntur.</hi> Whereas he saith, the subject matter is
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:118911:148"/>to treat of the Gospel; to this I answer, by granting that the general scope of this Evangelist is to declare the Gospel, yet this is not intended in every passage of the Gospel, but the proper drift of this part is to treat of a Divine Person: <hi>Quae non suppointur temporali principio, sed praeponitur;</hi> and to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie a question, where the word was in the <hi>beginning,</hi> and in effect the answer is, when the world began, he began not with it, nor was made when the world was made, but he was before it.</p>
                  <p>The places which are alledged as parallel to this in S. <hi>John</hi> are altogether unlike it, or else they do make against him. I will lay down this Rule not to be contradicted: That which is not determined in it selfe, may and must be explicated accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the circumstances of the Text, or concurrent Scriptures when they agree together in matter and analogy, and not other wise; here is treated of the Word absolutely, and touching his essence, but in most of the places alledged by the Adversaries is meant a temporary beginning of those that are spoken of, and in this absolute sense the Church of Christ for many ages hath expounded them, till men rose up which were bold to pervert plain Scriptures: besides, the <hi>Socinian</hi> sense is absurd, for thus it must be; in the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus, was Jesus Christ; or, in the beginning of the Gospel, Jesus Christ was the first Preacher of the Gospel: what is Gospel, but glad tidings of the comming of Christ? the Evangelist then sheweth in the beginning, when it was declared that Christ was come. <hi>Christ was;</hi> Is this a sentence beseeming the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Apostle to be placed in the front, and most conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous place of the Gospel? besides, this would render the first word of the Gospel to be ambiguous, for the beginning of the Gospel may be variously assigned. <hi>Mathew</hi> begins his Gospel from the Nativity of Christ, <hi>Luke</hi> b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, in the beginning of the Gospel: here beginning is clearly restrained in the Text to the Gospel. This may be retorted: Why doth Saint <hi>John</hi> simply say in the beginning and doth not add as <hi>Mark</hi> doth, in the beginning of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, if he had intended they should have been taken in that restrained sense.</p>
                  <p>The second place is <hi>Luke</hi> 1.2. Things famously acted amongst us, were delivered to us by such Instruments, which were from the beginning eye witnesses; this Text is unlike that of Saint <hi>John,</hi> for the Explication opening what is meant by the word, beginning, is evidently annexed to it.</p>
                  <p>The third place, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.7. <hi>I write unto you no new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,</hi> but an old, which ye had from the beginning: the restriction is here also expressed, <hi>Ye have heard from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,</hi> viz. of the Apostles preaching the Gospel, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the faith; what he commandeth, they had received formerly for Gods truth, and they ought not now to be drawn away to other perswasions, to think, as the Gnosticks held, that they might live unchristian lives, and yet be good Christians, Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> this Text there is also impertinently alledged.</p>
                  <p>The fourth place, v. 24. this place hath also a restriction in the words themselves. You have heard from the beginning of your Christianity, when the Gospel was first preached to you: these. Christians must needs have a being in this beginning. 5. And S. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11. doth necessarily admit the same Exposition: Love is the Fundamental Doctrine which hath been pressed on you from the beginning, <hi>viz</hi> from the time the Gospel was first preached to you.</p>
                  <p>As the fore alledged places make nothing for the Adversary, so the two remaining are against him.</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>Iohn,</hi> 1.1.7. That which was from the beginning, is meant of the Divine nature, which was in the beginning of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World, who was the fountain of life, who from al Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity continued with the Father, and who was in the Decree and purpose of God, and afterwards was foretold by him, and became man, that which we have heard from God speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:118911:149"/>from heaven, and really beheld, and was made known to our senses by seeing and handling him: he alludes to <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. and <hi>John</hi> 20.20. so that as <hi>Beza</hi> saith, he speaketh of Christ, as God, but not as simply God, but as God manifested in our flesh; so that both the Divine and humane nature do apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the Unity of the same person, and both are true in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry respects, he was seen and handled as he was man, but the whole of the word of life was neither seen nor handled.</p>
                  <p>1 <hi>John</hi> 2.13.14. Beginning here doth not denote the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the holy Gospel; the Text doth not thus run, you have known him, from the beginning of the Gospel, but, you have known him who was from the beginning: it is agreeable for old men, for men of your age being ancient to know the Ancient of dayes.</p>
                  <p>Thus hath Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> jumbled together many sacred texts, and some of them do make directly against him, and the rest are not paralells to the first of <hi>John,</hi> and by consequent they are not pertinently alledged, as I have cleared them up, and as it is said, they have <hi>solutionem in latere,</hi> but our commonly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived opinion formerly proved by me, is most agreeable both to the occasionall time of writing this Gospel, which (as is probable) was after Saint <hi>Iohns</hi> return from his banishment out of <hi>Pathmos,</hi> both to supply what was wanting in the other Evangelists, as also to be an Antidote against Mr. <hi>Biddles</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie, which <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus</hi> bad hatched in those days, and others also, which called into question the Godhead of our blessed Saviour; now the Apostles purpose was not, nor did it become the authority of him who was the Lords Secretary, to dispute in his writings with profane and blasphemous Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, but to instruct the Church of God, and positively to assert that Divine Truth formerly delivered and professed by the Church, and this he doth with that Majesty and Authority, that he may well be called a son of thunder, and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect as I said, he is compared to an Eagle, as Saint <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> is to a man, because he begins his Gospel with the pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of our Saviours humanity; Saint <hi>Mark</hi> to a Lion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with <hi>John Baptist,</hi> a man of courage; <hi>Luke</hi> to a calf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with <hi>Zachary</hi> a Priest, and so is Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> like an
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:118911:150"/>Eagle the chiefe of Birds, who mounted above the pitch of the other three Evangelists, even to the height of the Godhead of Christ, and to the most unsearchable mystery of the most glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and blessed Trin-unity, and do thou Christian Reader cast thy self upon the wings of this quick-sighted Eagle, and thou shalt (as it were) be carried into the bosom of God, and acquainted with those heavenly truths, which, had they not been revealed by God himselfe, could never have been dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered or imagined: by the first words of this holy Gospel, those wicked Hereticks which denied the Deity of Gods Son are refuted, as witnesseth S. <hi>Irenaeus, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>adver. haereses, cap.</hi> 11. who lived long before <hi>Athanasius</hi> and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan. haeres.</hi> 51. <hi>Augustin. de Haeres. cap.</hi> 8.10. <hi>Theodoret. haeretic. fabul. lib.</hi> 2. thou avouchest (wretched Heretick as thou art) that Christ had no real being, til he was conceived in the womb of his blessed Mother; but the holy Ghost who leadeth into all truth, saith, he was in the beginning: whom will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> or sacred Scripture? thou pleadest to make him yonger then his Virgin Mother, but the Holy Ghost makes him elder then <hi>Adam,</hi> who was the root of all Mankind. His Exposition agreeth not to the subject treated of, who was a Person, even God with the Father, and was also God in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which do transcend all temporal beginnings; nor doth it agree with the effects that follow, that is, all things were made by him: as this Exposition is unjust, so is it foolish and absurd. What is the meaning of these words, <hi>In the beginning was the Word?</hi> that is (saith <hi>Biddle</hi>) he was when he began to Preach the Gospel: what wise man useth such a manner of speech? he was a Man when he governed the Common-wealth, he was a man when he Preached; we may say indeed, he preached, therefore he had existence, and was a man: <hi>Ab est tertii ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecti, ad est secundi adjecti valet consequentia:</hi> but to say thus, he was when he began to govern, is unsavoury, not fit to come forth out of the mouth of a reasonable man, much less of a holy and divinely enlightned Apostle.

Consider with all reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and humility, that God the Father being from all Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity infinite in wisdome, hath had alwayes some conception in him, as a man hath in his understanding when he discourseth; this conception of man is not of the substance of the soul, but in God, who is absolutely most simple, and without all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of composition, there can be nothing, which is not his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine substance: now this conception of God the Father, is his eternal Son, but the like conception of man, is not the Son of man, whereas the Word being the Son of God must needs be of the same nature with the Father; this then is the first reason why the Son of God is called the Word, because he is so begotten of his Father, in such a manner, as our inward word or conception is framed in us, unlesse we do speak more fitly, and commodiously (saith learned <hi>Junius</hi>) in saying the Son of God is not <gap reason="foreign">

Lastly, by the hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis of the Adversaries, the Word should not have been with God, til he had been on Earth, and then with him but for a short time: but this agrees not with the Word; for Gods Word is with his Father before he is with other things, for the Word of God proceeds from God, and from no other, and therefore we must not imagine that first he is far from God, then ascended to God, and is after sent from God. Can we imagine, not truly I am sure, that he first ascended from Earth to Heaven, before he descended from Heaven to the Earth?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> indeed was rapt up into Heaven, and <hi>Moses</hi> went up to God on the Mount; for these we have plain Scriptures, but it is no where said, that Christ ascended up into Heaven, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Resurrection; now was there any need that he should be rapt up into Heaven to be taught of God as they were, for a fuller confirmation of his Office, sith the Holy Ghost at his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism descended on him, and the Father testified of him, that he was his Beloved Son, and people were commanded to hear him, sith the Godhead dwelt in him bodily, and sith he was alwayes in the Father, and the Father in him.</p>

But I do further observe a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in the Adversary: Mark here that he saith, Christ was
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:118911:154"/>taken up into Heaven, that he received absolute and certain knowledge of the Kingdome of Heaven, and became the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Interpreter of Gods Will: but in his sixt Article, pag. 47. you shall hear him sing another Song: Whereas Christ (saith he) whiles he lived a mortal life on Earth (which certainly he did til after his passion) was wont in many things to be taught by the Spirit, <hi>Esa.</hi> 11.2. yet after his exaltation he gave the Spirit instruction, what he was to make known to his Disciples; how do these things hang together? to say he was taught being in Heaven with God before he preached, and he had absolute knowledge of the Kingdome of Heaven, before he made choice of his Disciples, and at the same time, and after to be taught many things by the Spirit, is an irreconcileable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I must mind both mine Adversary and the Reader once again of the unreasonable and horrible blasphemy invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in his words; that God as touching his essentiall presence is onely in heaven and that it was needfull for Christ to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend locally to the throne of the Divine Majesty, before he published the Gospel, as though God could not instruct him as his Ambassadour to man, what was the pleasure of God touching mans salvation whiles he was on earth, without his Ascension into heaven? true and enflamed zeal for God cannot without indignation and horrour, read such intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble blasphemies. Gods ubiquity, 'tis true, as his Essence, is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unknown to us, whence that rule; whatsoever is spoken of God, taken from the consideration of the creatures, is to be understood rather negatively than affirmatively, and when the perfection of the creatures is attributed to God, it is (as Schoolmen say) <hi>secundum supereminentiae modum,</hi> in that su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pereminent manner, which is imperceptible to us: thus we say, God is every where: this Proposition is not affirmatively true, but according to that supereminent manner, which is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us, sith the diuine Majesty, as the Councel of <hi>Ephesus</hi> saith, is above all place and every measure, and sith Gods ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity respect no perfection in the creature, it is to be expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed negatively thus, God is every where, <hi>i.e.</hi> hath no limits of nature, nor is excluded out of any thing: no more of that.</p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:118911:155"/>
                  <p>The Adversaries Exposition being confuted, I will indeavour to shew the true meaning of the Text, <hi>The Word was with God.</hi> Verily, there is but one God; God then must not be taken for the Godhead simply and absolutely, but for God the Father; the person is signified and not the Divine Nature, whence the <hi>Sabellians</hi> are confuted, which fancied against evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Scripture, that God was but one person called in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers respects, sometimes the Father, sometimes the Son, and somtimes the Holy Ghost, but no respects can make this speech reasonable, if there be but one person in the Godhead: as a man may say, <hi>John</hi> was an Apostle, <hi>Iohn</hi> was an Evangelist, <hi>Iohn</hi> was the Disciple that Christ loved; but none can well say, <hi>Iohn</hi> was with the Disciple whom Christ loved: it is one thing to be with the Evangelist <hi>Iohn;</hi> and another thing; to be the Evangelist <hi>Iohn,</hi> that may belong to any but to <hi>Iohn,</hi> this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth to none but <hi>Iohn</hi> himself: no respect will clear that speech from absurdity, if the party spoken of be one and the same, as well for person as for nature.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Evangelist having in the former clause named the Word. <hi>In the beginning was the Word:</hi> he doth not say, in the beginning was the Son, but he doth here more fitly mention the <hi>Word</hi> God, then God the Father; for so the correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence betwixt them seems to require; the Son of the Father, and the Word of God with God: here is distinction and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the persons with God, not as an Attribute, but as a person distinctly existing.</p>
                  <p>Besides, it helps the elegancy of speech, which the Holy Ghost useth, in that he makes the last word of the first clause, the first of the second, thus; <hi>In the beginning was the Word,</hi> then revealed, <hi>and the word was with God;</hi> and in the next also, <hi>God was the word,</hi> for so runs the originall: suppose now Saint <hi>John</hi> had said, <hi>The word was with the Father,</hi> the grace of the speech had been lost, because he could not have repeated <hi>the Word,</hi> in the beginning of the following clause; for it cannot be said, the Father is the Word, or the Word the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but to say, <hi>God was the Word,</hi> is a true and elegant speech compared with the former.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, I may adde also, that in the old Testament, where
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:118911:155"/>the Messias is prophetically spoken of, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. and <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.12. rarely shall you find any distinct mention of the first person under the name of the Father; therefore the holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle makes choice of such a name of God the Father, as that whereby his speech might best be approved and understood.</p>
                  <p>Thus have I out of our best interpreters collected (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive) what may give some light to this Scripture under de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, the scope and principal drift whereof was this, as Saint <hi>Basil in verba, Iohn</hi> having said, <hi>The word was in the beginning,</hi> and that he had already his glorious being, when all things that were originally created began to be. Well then, if the Word subsisted before the World began, if he really was before there was any time and place wherein he might subsist, some may haply demand, where was he then before the World and time? The Evangelist answereth plainly and satisfactorily, he was with God, even as the inward Word or conception which a man frameth within himself, or as his <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is with the man where he is, so is the eternal Word with God; but mark the distinction in the different manner of being. The word was not God the Father, with whom he was from all eternity; for albeit they are one in nature, for the Son is not a diverse nature from the Father, as another God, yet are they really distinct persons, so that Christ was with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not after he was incarnated onely, and after his Passion, by his local ascension up into heaven, but before the beginning of the World, even in the first moment of the first beginning, when as yet there was neither time nor place compleated, even then had the Word his being with God.</p>
                  <p>To this I further adde what is asserted by <hi>Tolet</hi> the Jesuit on the place, and approved by some of ours to carry great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability; that the Evangelist by this repetition would further give us to understand, that the Word was not onely in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, but was then with God the Father a co-worker in the Creation of all things: the ground of this Interpretation is from <hi>Prover.</hi> 8. where first his eternity is described, <hi>v.</hi> 22. and <hi>v.</hi> 27. the same Wisdome was with God as a nourisher when he prepared the heavens, that is, creating and ordering all things, and he saith, <hi>When he prepared the heaven, I was there:</hi> to this of the Wise man, these words of Saint <hi>John</hi> do
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:118911:156"/>correspond, <hi>The Word was with God from the beginning.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The Texts alledged out of the sixth chapter of Saint <hi>John</hi> are in themselves clear enough to overthrow all that Master <hi>Biddle</hi> intends to build up thereby.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Arg.</hi> The truth of his essential presence is proved first by Scriptures. 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.27. <hi>The Heaven</hi> (saith <hi>Solomon) and the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain thee; much lesse can this house:</hi> we are not to have the least thoughts that <hi>Solomon</hi> built an house to contain God, for he is not contained in the heavens, much less in this house; he doth not only speak of Gods vertue and providence, but of God himselfe, as Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence cannot be comprehended in Heaven, no more can God himselfe, for otherwise God should be infinite in regard of his providence, but not infinite in regard of his essence: can an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite vertue pertain to a finite essence? nay verily, the power of God can be no more infinite then his essence, for God by his essence of and by himself is powerful and infinite.</p>
                  <p>The Psalmist lends us his suffrage to this truth: <hi>Whither shall I go from thy spirit? if I ascend into Heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed in Hell, behold, thou art there; if I go to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most parts of the Sea, thou are there also, Psal.</hi> 139.7, 8, 9. God is in Heaven, and in Hell, and in all parts of the World, not only in regard of his knowledge and providence, but of his essence, for he is so on Earth, as he is in Heaven; nor doth the Psalmist say, <hi>How shall I flie from thy Providence?</hi> but, <hi>from thy Spirit, from thy face:</hi> nor is any action of God any where but God is essentially present there.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jerem,</hi> 23.23. <hi>Am I a God at hand, saith the Lord, and not a God afar off? Can any hide himselfe in secret places, that I shall not see him, saith the Lord? Do not I (saith God) fill Heaven and Earth:</hi> in this Text, as in the rest where mention is made of Gods presence, Heaven and Earth are joyned together, and 'tis alwayes said, either he can be contained in no place, or that he fils all places, and is alwayes in himselfe most present to all things: nor doth this help the Adversary, to say such places are
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:118911:158"/>ment of Gods power and providence, because 'tis said, he is not a God afar off, for he saith expresly of his person, in the first per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, I, and not I, in regard of his operation onely. This is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy consequence; God can do all things afar off, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in regard of his Essence he is not present with all things: 'tis all one in regard of God, whether he be said to be nearer or further off from men, seeing he is every where present, and fills heaven and earth, and hypocrites are more fully convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of their folly by this phrase, in thinking they can hide themselves from God, for he in regard of his essence fills all places, he is not distant from any creature by any imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry space interposed betwixt Gods existence, and the creatures substance.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Arg.</hi> The second Argument is drawn from Gods Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute of perfection: God is most absolutely perfect; to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where in regard of essence, denotes a higher degree of perfection, then to be limited to a place, as it would be a greater perfection to a King to be essentially present all over his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then to be there by his Authority and power onely, for on this account we excuse disorders in a Kingdome, and often justly; because such is mans condition, that he cannot know abuses being absent so well as if he had been every where present; so is it true, that Gods ubiquity is no imperfection, but a high degree of perfection, as it is by the Adversaries ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be a higher degree of perfection to be every where present in regard of operation, than either to work in heaven alone, or on earth, or any one place: Gods power is not separated from his essence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Arg.</hi> Thirdly, this is proved from the consideration of Gods nature, which is infinite without measure, end or bounds, which depends on no creature, who hath no Superiour nor e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall to limit his nature, and the Adversaries granting that the power and Wisdome of God (which they take to be acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in God) are infinite and incomprehensible, must by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence yield, that Gods essence is infinite, for how is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible, that infidite accidents in intension should be in a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of finite extension? for the manner of working doth not exceed the manner of being; an essence that is not infinite cannot produce infinite operations, nor can it have an infinite
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:118911:158"/>vertue to produce them; in an infinite there is nothing that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits more or lesse and this is true of God and of his Attributes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Arg.</hi> Fourthly, God is not so essentially in the Heavens, but that he is out of the Heavens also, he is not contained in Heaven, and this is proved. 1. God was not in Heaven before the Creation, and when they were created, we must not think he went out of himself, changing, as it were, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>s place, and betaking himself to dwell in that Heavenly Pallace, when it was created in the beginning, for certainly before there was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny creature, God was alone, he was to himself, the World, and place, and all things, <hi>Tertull advers. Prax.</hi> 2. If God should annihilate all the world, as he is able to do, would not God be there where he is now? and therefore he is not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed to heaven. 3. If God should create new heavens (as 'tis not impossible for him to do) could not God, or would not God be in those Heavens also? yes verily, though not as <hi>locatum in loco,</hi> but as in himself blessed for ever, as a cause creating and preserving all things <hi>per essentiae</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>Arg.</hi> if God was not essentially present every where, these and the like absurdities would necessarily follow. First, God should be measured by place, as his duration by time, and his substance should be circumscribed in a place, or limited by it, which is a property of a creature, and to avouch that Gods substance can be dilated or contracted, is anathematized in the Synod of <hi>Syrmium.</hi> Secondly, Then should Gods greatnesse in respect of his Essence and presence differ from that of a creature, not in kind, but gradually. Thirdly, Gods Essence either fills the whole heavens, or a part of it onely: if you say the whole, I ask then, Why cannot Gods Essence be out of heaven, and have either a greater or a lesser place? Who limits him, or what is it that sets bounds to his supream Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, saying, as to the sea, Hither mayest thou go, but no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? If you say a part of heaven, I demand again, Why this part rather than that? and why so much place, and no more? Cannot he remove to another place? and if so he is, and if he be essentially absent in any place of heaven, he is then no more in that place, by the Adversaries Confession, then on the earth.</p>
                  <p>I have touched on this Subject above, and have now in a fifth place more fully confirmed this truth denied by the Adversary
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:118911:159"/>to the great dishonour of God Almighty: much more is set down in large Discourses of our learned Writers touching Gods omnipresence, chiefly in Dr. <hi>Hammond.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Text cited <hi>John</hi> 8.42. proves, that Christ did not run and prophesie before he was sent, as the Jews his professed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies imagined, but that he was immediatly sent from his Father, and what he did in his office was not done of his own motion, but by Commission from God: he ran not before he was sent, as false Prophets were wont to do, but by his Fathers counsel and authority, this he speaks to stop the mouths of the J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Christs going out from the Father, and coming into the World, do denote something which follows his mission, and appertains to the execution thereof. If you ask, why Christ went out from his Father, who is (as they say) <hi>terminus à quo,</hi> and why he came into the World, as the <hi>terminus ad quem,</hi> it is fitly answered, as in the Text, because he was sent of his Father, for the end of the execution of the Mission cannot be obtained, unlesse an Ambassadour goes out from his Prince that sent him, and so going out from his Father, signifies his going from his Father out of heaven, and on this ground it is, that no Prophets or Apostles are said in Scripture to go out from God, <hi>Placens Disput.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>This Text then chiefly denotes the external relation of Gods Son to his Father, and is terminated in that considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor doth it intend (as Arians and Politicians dream) a locall descent of a meer creature from heaven, but the end is chiefly to be considered, which is not to teach the eternal ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of Gods Son, but his mission and office to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and doe import that he that was sent was Gods natural Son, as S. <hi>Cyril</hi> saith; to proceed from the Father, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues his Divinity; to come into the world, argues his Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: Gods Son incarnated is manifested thereby to come into the world; yea God himselfe is said to descend from Heaven, <hi>Genes.</hi> 11.1. <hi>i.e.</hi> he manifested himself by some remarkable sign of his presence: yea, and our Saviour himselfe saith, <hi>I and my Father will come to the faithfull and dwell with them, as the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Christ came into the World where he was not before, <hi>viz.</hi> in his Humane Nature: yea, to take notice of your wise choice, 1. <hi>John</hi> 15. the Text saith, <hi>He was before John,</hi> though born after him: he was not only preferred before him in favour and dignity, but <hi>He was before me: i. e.</hi> he had a being long, even infinitely before me; for he was begotten of his Father before all things, <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.15.17. this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Bid. <hi>And the word was a God (as being indued with divine power and Empire) for according to the reasoning of Christ himself</hi> John 10.35. <hi>if the Psalmist cals them Gods to whom the word of God came, and the Scripture cannot be broken (as it would, if any one should deny them to be Gods) is not he much more a God, who is indued with so divine a dominion, that he is the very substantiall Son of God?</hi>

                     </gap>, the Article presixed, sheweth that the word is the subject and not the predicate in this clause by it selfe enun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated, and lest any should conceive that the Word was God, (as the <hi>Arians</hi> were wont to do, and in this the <hi>Socinians</hi> agree with them) to avoid the evidence of the place, he saith in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, that <hi>he made all things:</hi> and in another place he saith, that he

                  <p>Whereas Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi> saith, that he is God, in that he was indued with Divine power: this explication in an orthodox sense is admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for how can Christ be God, if he hath not Divine power, but in the <hi>Socinian</hi> sense tis inconsistent with the truth, as I have at large demonstrated, <hi>Gods power is Gods glory, Esay</hi> 42. which he will give to no other, nor can a creature which is finite be capable of that po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer which is infinite. I ask, how is Christ indued with Divine power which is surely infinite? hath he it intrinsecally, so as to denominate the Humane Nature truly omnipotent? if so, then hath he the infinite essence, and by consequent is true God, which the Adversary will not admit. Or hath he it extrinsecally, because the omnipotent God dwels in him? if in this latter sense, what singular thing is here a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched which belongs not to all the faithfull?</p>
                  <p>I grant, some Attributes of God are said to be communicable, as others are called incommunicable; but how communicable? only by analogical accommodation, not in respect of the properties themselves, which are all of them infinite, yea in truth one infinite God, but in regard of the effects of those properties, wherein the creature doth imperfectly resemble the Creator. Gods Attributes are the Divine essence it self, his Name, his Glory, his Godhead, and if any of the properties were truly communicated, the essence of God must be multiplied, divided, or distracted from it selfe, but there cannot possibly be more then one infinite; and therefore all Gods Attributes do signifie one single and infinite perfection, as wisedome, power, mercy.</p>
                  <p>The scope of the Evangelist will make good what we do maintain against the <hi>Socinians:</hi> the Scripture saith he was God; the Text saith not that the Word is God, but the Word was God, namely, in the beginning: if then we shall grant with the Adversary, that Christ was only man, and that by beginning, is meant the beginning of the preaching of the Gospel, then cannot it be made out by any other text of Scripture, that Christ was God at that time: if then the Apostle intended to prove Jesus to be the <hi>Messias,</hi> as the Adversaries say, who can believe that he would in the first verse set down that which was more obscure then that which he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to prove, and which could not be proved to be true by any other Text. 2.

                  <p>To the tenth of Saint <hi>John</hi> I have largely answered, and 'tis need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse to repeat what may there be read: angels and men in the old Testament are sometimes called Gods, the shadow of good things remaining, and the Sun not being risen to expell them; and they are so called in the Plural number only, and a singular Magistrate is not called a God, nor were they then to be worshipped with Divine Worship, nor equall with God, nor searchers of mens hearts, and reins, but the Word is called God, when the day is come, and that in the singular number particularly is the name of God, yea and Divine Worship, attributed to him, who accounts it no robbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be equal with God, and whose Prerogative it is to be a search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the reins and hearts, and who is the Judge of the whole World, from whose Throne there can be no appeal.</p>
                  <p>The Adversary calls our Saviour the Substantiall Word, and that without ambiguity stands not well with his own principles, but where is the man amongst us, which will say otherwise? The words in Saint <hi>John</hi> are evident: the word was not onely with God, whose being depends not upon time, place, or any creatures, all which were made by him, but <hi>the Word was God,</hi> that is, the Divine Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not in regard of any office; for there is no testimony of Scripture, which denies him to be by nature God, or which affirms him to be made a God at any time, nor is there any Text of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which shews him to be man in the beginning, or that he which was God, might not become man also <hi>v.</hi> 14. never was there a question, or so much as doubted, that God was before the beginning of the World, but there were found some miscreants, as <hi>Ebion</hi> and <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> before the writing of the Gospel, and the Arians after them, which impugned this Deity of our Saviour: the holy Evangelist decides the doubt, and expresly saith, he was God; which was the thing, which he intended to avouch of him: hence there
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:118911:161"/>have been found men, which have so much admired this first verse, that they have wished it was written with letters of Gold, and to put all out of doubt, in the next verse he signifies the Divinity, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, Omnipotency, and Equality of the Word, or Son with God the Father, by saying, all things were made by him, both vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible and invisible, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. whereupon it is evident that he is no creature, because he is the Creatour of all things, and v. 4. <hi>In him was life.</hi> All the particulars here spoken of, are spoken of the Word, and the whole frame and scope of the Gospel, is to teach us, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and by believing we might live through him, <hi>John</hi> 21 31.</p>

                  <p>To this I answer first, that albeit sometimes the force of an Article is of use and observation, yet is a Grammatical quillet too weak to sway a cause of this weight and value. I do ask the Adversary this question, is the Arricle never omitted, when the true God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly spoken of? If it be omitted, and that often, as I have shewed, where then lies the strength of the Argument? (Articles, saith our learned <hi>Casaubone</hi> against <hi>Baronius, Exercitat.</hi> 2. are not alwayes to be urged, they are often omitted in Scripture, <hi>ubi Helle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nismus exactior eos requirebat,</hi> and another, <hi>Camier.

This is further evidenced by comparing the Texts taken out of the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, and cited in the new, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.1. Was he not the true God, and called the Lord of Hosts, that sent <hi>John Baptist</hi> before the face of the Messias, and yet Saint <hi>John</hi> saith, <hi>There was a man sent from God?</hi> here God is without an article: this one place is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to confute that vain and false exception, especially being in the same Evangelist, and within a few lines of the former; nor can it be doubted, but that God, <hi>Whom no man hath seen at any time,</hi> is the true God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 34.20.23. <hi>Thou canst not see my face:</hi> doth not Saint <hi>John</hi> speak of the same true God, when he saith, <hi>No man hath seen God at any time? v.</hi> 18. the Word (God) in this place also is without an Article, and if the addition of an Article proves that God, to which it is affixed, to be the true God, the Adversaries cause is lost, <hi>Act.</hi> 20 28.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there may be a reason rendered, why it being added to God in the first clause, should be omitted in the next, lest the Readers should be misled to think the person of the Word was confounded, and one and the same with the Person of God the Father.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, 'tis not unusuall for Saint <hi>John</hi> to put an Article to the first Word, and when he repeats the Word to omit the Article as <hi>John</hi> 1.14. <hi>His glory, as the glory,</hi> 45, 46. <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Nathana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> 46, 47. <hi>John</hi> 6.5.7 <hi>Flesh, Iohn</hi> 3.6 <hi>Abraham, Iohn</hi> 8.39▪ 40. <hi>God, Iohn</hi> 9.31.33, and <hi>Iesus, John</hi> 21.4. What marvel is it then, if Saint <hi>John</hi> adding an Article to God in the first place, omits it in the second place?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, we may guesse at the reason, why God in the last Clause is without an Article, because in the second clause God no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth God the Father, who is the first of the three glorious persons in order, but in the third place its taken for the nature of God, which
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:118911:162"/>is most singularly one and the same in all the three persons. If the Evangelist had omitted or added the Article in both, the sense of the place would have been more obscure, and the Distinction of the persons not easily discerned.</p>
                  <p>Lastly, it could not have been so evident as it is now, that the Word was to be taken for the former part of the speech, but much doubted whether the Evangelist intended to inform us, that God was the Word (as the words in the Greek do evidently lie) or that (as most do place them, &amp; the adversary himself) the word was God.</p>
                  <p>There is but one God, this is a fundamentall Article, God the Father, and God the Son are not two Gods, but one God: now when it is said, the Word was with God, for cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, God is not taken here essentially, but as Divines do speak, <hi>Synechdochichally</hi> or personally, namely for God the Father; this being supposed, that which you call ridiculous, is very congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous both to found reason and the holy Scriptures: God the Son is not properly with himself, but with another, that is, with God his Father; who is <hi>alius,</hi> another person from his Father, but not <hi>aliud,</hi> another thing essentially differing from him: the Text may be illustrated by this paralell example in Paradise. <hi>Adam</hi> was a man in Paradise, <hi>Eve</hi> was with this man, and <hi>Eve</hi> was a man, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.17. a reasonable creature, as <hi>Adam</hi> was. Is this ridiculous? Christ was with God, taken formally for the Divine person, and in regard of proper relation distinguished from him, but not in nature, which is common to both persons: its a Sophisters part thus to plead; part of the air is not air, part of a line is not the line, because the same thing is not a part of it self: it is answered by a deniall, for part of the air is air, and part of the line is a line, for though air, and part of the air do differ according to the proper respects and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the whole and part, yet not according to the nature of the air, which as an homogeneal body belongs equally to both: and as the word of God is not God properly, for none can be his own word, say Socinians, this is already answered, for when one man is said to be with another man, is not the one of them a man, as well as the other? There is I grant a difference, because there are more men than one man, but there is but one God: hence may we infer, that God the Son is undivided from God the Father, with whom he was as the Scripture saith, I <hi>and the Father am one.</hi> Suppose the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle had said, In the beginning was light, and this light was with God, and that light was God, or, in the beginning was Charity,
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:118911:162"/>and Charity was with God, and God was Charity: None of these Propositions could be denyed, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.2.5 and 4.8.16. could the Adversary infer, that these, as also Gods Power. Will, were qualities or accidents separable from God, and not in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Divine? The Divinity then of our Saviour is not by Mr. <hi>Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles</hi> exact examination of this Text overthrown by it.</p>

                  <p>Bid. <hi>But were all that we have said laid aside, this very thing (if men had not renounced their Reason, and made non-sense the Mother of their devotion) is sufficient to decide the controversie, that Christ is called in the Scriptures the Son of the most high God; for if he be both the Son of the most high God, and the most high God too, he will be the Son of himselfe, which is absurd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> Fairer language (Mr. <hi>Biddle</hi>) would have been more comly &amp; commendable for you, then to cast dirt in the most beautifull face of Christs beloved Spouse: should such an empty and worthlesse man as this Adversary is, lay such a harsh imputation on all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches but his own, and on the most famous Christians in the World, to say, that they do renounce their reason, and do make non-sense the mother of their devotion? 'tis true our Religion teacheth us, as obsequious children to imbrace and not to dispute against the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of our heavenly Father revealed to us, and we do justly esteem it our wisdome to follow the wisdome of our unerring Guide: it fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with this sweet truth, the Son of God became the Son of Man, as with that blessed doctrine, to believe that Christ was crucified for us, which was, and yet is a stumbling block to the Jews, and at first promulgation thereof, foolishnesse to the Gentiles.</p>
                  <p>To your objection which depends on a term equivocal, I answer, as I have often done, and so shall not need to spend much time on this subject: it is agreeable both to sense and reason regulated and refined by the Word of God, and it contains a good sense devoutly to be imbraced, and without contradiction to be believed, Jesus Christ is the co-essential Son of his Father, the most high God, and he himselfe is also the most high God truly and really in respect of his person distinct from his Father, and 'tis blaspemy not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured in a Christian to say, one person of the holy Trinity is higher then another; and although there be the same essence of the Father and the Son, yet is not the Son begotten of the Essence, as it is his, but as it is the Fathers; as it follows not, the essence of this matter of which water is generated, is also an essential part of water, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore water is begotten of it selfe: or thus, the essence of the seed out of which Wheat is generated, is the essence of the Wheat gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, therefore Wheat generates it selfe: so here, the order be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Father begetting and the Son begotten, is also betwixt the essence; as it is the Fathers, and as it is the Sons.

                  <p>AGain, <hi>Though Christ be a God subordinate to the most high God, as having received his Godhead, and whatsoever he hath from the Father; yet may not any one thence rightly infer, That by this account there will be another God, or two Gods. For though we may with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of the Scripture say, That there are many Gods, yet neither will the Scripture, nor the thing it self permit us to say, There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God; or two Gods, because when a word, in its own nature common to many, hath been appropriated and ascribed to one by way of excellent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">

Thus though some faithful man be a Son of God, subordinate to the chief Son of God Christ Jesus, yet may we not thereupon say, That there is another Son of God, or two Sons of God (since that would be to make another or two Sons of God by way of excellency, whereas there can be but one such a Son:) howbeit, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Scripture warrants us to say, That there are many Sons of God.</hi>

                  <p>This Article is unlike its fellowes, in that the Commentary and the Text is more concise then the Article it self, and might well have been omitted, as having no new and singular matter or proof contained in it; but that only is aimed at, which hath been fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently inculcated; <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Christ is a God,</hi> not by <hi>Nature,</hi> but by <hi>favour;</hi> and that he hath his Godhead (such as it is) only by Grace; and that Godhead is different also from the Godhead of the Father, who is the true and most high God: What is singular in this Article concerneth the manner of speeches and phrases, and not at all the substance of the Question under debate, so that I might without any prejudice to the maine cause have passed it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in silence, and have given you leave to speak your owne

                  <p>The Scripture speaketh of many gods, yet not of two Gods, or diverse Gods. I must tell you, that there is a vast difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the attribution of God to a creature, or Idol God, and to the Son of God. The true God saith, <hi>I have made thee a God to Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,</hi> Ex. 7. and it calleth all those Rulers which had their commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from God by the name of Gods: but doth the Scripture say in any one place, That <hi>Moses</hi> or the Magistrates were God simply? No: Or saith the Holy Ghost in any divine Book, That Christ was a made God? He that reads, <hi>I have made thee a God,</hi> can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily conceive, this made God is not the true God; and as easie it is for any man to assure himself, that those Governors were not Gods indeed, not only because they were many (whereas God is but one) but because they ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> presently threatned, that they shal<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dy like men; But now when the Scripture speaketh of Christ, it doth in some places simply and absolutely call him God, whose eternity and presence with God the Father before the world, is avouched, &amp; to whom the Creation of all things is ascribed. If the Holy Ghost had said, that Christ had been a made God, or if the Lord had only affirmed, that he had called him God, there might have been then some occasion to doubt of the truth of his Deity, because there are some such like speeches attributed to other men in Scripture; but it is wilful wrangling to call so plain a truth into question, upon so unlike a manner of speech. A subordinate God is a God, as a subordinate cause is truly a cause: and to say in your sense, there is one high God, and another inferior God, yea, and many Gods, and yet not to allow by a distinction, to say, there are two Gods or many Gods; <hi>viz.</hi> one properly so called, and another impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, is (as I conceive) to abandon reason with devotion; to acknowledg many Gods, and yet in that sense as there are many, to deny two Gods, is an implicite contradiction, for the greater number must necessarily include the lesser; and there cannot be many, except there be two: and what inconvenience upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession will follow, if the former limitation be observed, I would gladly learn. May not I say, that a sick man is cured by two ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient causes, by God principally, and by the Physician under
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:118911:164"/>God instrumentally? That Miracles were wrought by the Name, Authority and Power of Christ as the prime Agent, and by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apostles and others ministerially?</p>
                  <p>Touching your rule, (to passe by that which you take for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and which in your sense is undoubtedly false,) That the Father is only God by way of excellency, excluding the Son of God and the Holy Ghost, and not only the creatures from partaking of his Excellency. It may thus far be well granted, when thus limited, If a word properly and by way of excellency is ascribed to one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, then can it not properly (I mean) and in the same respect by way of excellency, belong to any other person; yet this hinders not but the same name improperly, or for some Analogical resemblance may be attributed to others. Thus may we say, that Angels and Magistrates are called Gods, and other Gods distinguished from God Almighty.</p>
                  <p>To illustrate your rule, you add (magisterially without proof) <hi>When two are segregated in this manner out of many, they claim to themselves excellency alike. One faithful man may be called the Son of God, yet may we not say, there is another Son of God, or two Sons of God, this would be to make alike excellent.</hi> If this which you speak in reference to Christ had been true, as it is not, he differing from other sons of God not only gradually but specifically, yet in your sense that rule is false; for Christ is Gods Son, you think, only in a more excellent degree then others. Shall we say, that <hi>Isaac</hi> had not two sons, or that <hi>Esau</hi> was not <hi>Jacobs</hi> brother? That <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> had not two sons, because <hi>Isaac</hi> was the son of the Promise, a better son, and more beloved of <hi>Abraham</hi> then <hi>Ishmael?</hi> Or, that <hi>Jacob</hi> had not twelve sons, because <hi>Reuben,</hi> (if he had not fallen) was to have been honoured as his first born, the excellency of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the excellency of Power? Or, that <hi>Joseph</hi> had not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny brethren, because <hi>Jacob</hi> his father loved him above all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and made him a coat of diverse colours? Besides, to say thus, Christ is the natural Son of God, and as he is our Mediator, Gods Son by grace of union; and <hi>Abraham</hi> is the adopted son of God; two sons in a different sense, is no way absurd: and why may not I say God hath two sons in such a family, twenty in such a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation? This is truly spoken, and doth not at all import, that there are many sons alike excellent; and <hi>Solomon</hi> in a special manner is called son of God, a Type of our Saviour, and what is spoken of
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:118911:165"/>him as a Type, is improper, and properly belonged to Christ as prefigured by him. But how will you shift off this instance, and be true to your own rule? Christ is called an <hi>Apostle, Hebr.</hi> 3.1. and you neither can nor will deny, but he is so called by way of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency; and yet we do read of twelve Apostles, and that the new <hi>Jerusalem</hi> had twelve gates, which had the names of the twelve A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21. Cannot I say that <hi>Peter</hi> is an Apostle, but he must be as excellent as Christ? the like may be said of the name Teacher, Saviour, Servant, <hi>Isai.</hi> 42. <hi>Numb.</hi> 12. by way of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency ascribed to Christ; yet are there other Teachers, called also <hi>Saviours</hi> in <hi>Obadiah;</hi> others then Christ called <hi>Saviours;</hi> and other servants.</p>
                  <p>I grant, An Attribute common to many is not common to them alwayes taken singly, neither <hi>Attributivè,</hi> as the Learned phrase it; or if so, yet not <hi>Subjectivè;</hi> an example of the first kind, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates are in Scripture called sometimes Gods; yet take this or that Magistrate, and then in an approved phrase, it is not the custom to say (which hath a great sway in phrase) I have seen God to day, I have saluted God: or if a Magistrate hath done any thing, we do not say, relating to him, God hath done this or that thing. An example of the latter kind, Consecrated Bread and Wine in Scripture are called the Body and Blood of Christ; the name of the body of Christ is attributed to Bread, yet if this bread falls to the ground, or this Wine is spilt, the Scripture phrase is not to say, Christs body fell to the ground, or his blood was spilt; and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tismal water is called the Laver of Regeneration, yet do not we say, If this water be cast on the ground, the water of Regenerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is cast down.

                  <p>There were some Christians in those Primitive dayes (Gnosticks) which asserted their liberty to eat at the Idol Feasts, because forsooth they argued, an Idol was nothing. The Apostle confesseth their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to be true, that the Heathen Gods were the fictions of mens braines, and their Images and representations the works of mens hands, and that there is to us Christians but one God. This Scripture hath been already discussed, <hi>Page</hi> 70. The sum of the Adversaries Argument is this, There is but one God the Father, therefore but one divine person: The Antecedent is the Doctrine and confession of the Prophets and Apostles: But the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is denyed, There is but one God, but there are three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantial Persons. Mans specifical nature, as the Learned know, is but one, yet are there many humane persons.

Gods Son) <hi>for whom are all things, and by whom are all things</hi> (as in the cited place to the Colossians) and who was to bring ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Sons to glory, the Prince (I say) of their salvation. <hi>(See Par. in locum.)</hi> then the Text may be retorted against the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. However the Deity of our Saviour is implied in that Title, by calling him the Prince of our salvation; for had he not been the Most High God, had he beene only a holy and innocent man, hee might have saved himselfe, but he could not have saved others.</p>
                  <p>I have now faithfully refuted, and by the help of God examined what the Adversary hath objected against the holy Trinity, and what he hath to say against the eternal being of the Son of God, and what for his subordination, as he is a God to his Father; and I have shewed, that the holy Texts mustered by him have no hand to strike a stroke in that Battle for which they are levied. A poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonful Doctrine this is, and stoutly asserted, but can never be sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proved by any Socinian, as it doth, I hope, partly appear by my answer to the Adversaries Objections, and by his subtle elusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to avoid the strength of our Arguments.

<pb n="282" facs="tcp:118911:168"/>take notice of, He is not an Advocate to plead their cause with God immediately, and in his own person, as Lawyers do their Clyents cause before a Judge; this indeed would have argued both his actual separation from, and his inferiority to the great God; but this is done by his gracious works in the hearts of Disciples and Christians, teaching them, as your self confesse in your first reason of this Name, how to plead the cause of Christ against persecuting Rulers, and a world of unbelievers. This is done, as the Learned briefly answer, not <hi>formaliter</hi> by him, but <hi>efficienter;</hi> and this was foretold to the comfort and strengthning the faith of the Apostles, That when Christ was gone corporally from them, the Paraclete should come to them, &amp; they should see his power in convincing and converting many of the unbelieving world, of the Jews immediately, and of Gentiles in future times by the Ministry of the Apostles: the Spirit by them should <hi>reprove the world of sin, of righteousnesse and of judgment,</hi> John 16.8. The coming of the Holy Ghost should be a convincing Argument that Christ was a true Prophet; and therefore the Jewes that had a hand in his death, were guilty of a great sin in not believing on him, and of a greater in crucifying him. And this is the first work, and necessary to fit a sinner for Christ. 2. He would convince the world of Righteousnesse; by assuring the Disciples of Christ, that albeit he suffered as a Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, yet he was an innocent person; which is proved by this, That God took him up into heaven, whither no unholy and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean person can enter. And 3 of Judgment, given to Christ, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Satan, that put it into the hearts of Scribes, Pharisees, and their associates to accuse Christ, and put him to a shameful death. Now by the coming of the Holy Ghost, the Kingdom of Satan, by the preaching of the everlasting Gospel, shall be gradually destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yea, and his professed enemies were shortly after ruined; and this Prophesie began to be fulfilled, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. when three thousand were converted by one plain Sermon of <hi>Peter.</hi> Thus in effect is the Text opened by <hi>Piscator, Grotius, D.

This Text then is so far from weakning of the Deity of the holy Ghost, that it strongly proves him to be the great Jehovah; for who but the Lord God can instruct all the Disciples of Christ in all the world, and at all times to plead the cause of Christ, and teach them in their needs what to pray?</p>

If it be generally meant, it is false and denyed, for sending is not alwayes a command of a Superiour over an Inferiour, but sometimes an act of wisdom and of counsel; the Holy Ghost is sent both by the Father and the Son with his own consent, and doth not argue their dominion over him. An equal person by consent, may be sent by him that is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to him, and then he that is sent is the primary cause of his own misson, and derogates nothing from the perfection of him
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:118911:169"/>that is sent; and how false the rule of <hi>Bidle</hi> is, that Inferiours are only sent, may (besides experience) be evinced out of <hi>Zachary, ch.</hi> 2.8. and 10.11. and 4.8, 9. and 6.12. the person that sends, and the person that is sent, is called, <hi>The Lord of Hosts.</hi> Can the Creator be sent by the Creature?

Nor is the sending of the Holy Ghost to be understood in regard of his person simply, but in regard of his Gifts and graces, whether they be common, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.4. as the gift of Miracles, which is consequential to faith, either saving or unsound, common illumination, and such like: or such as belong to the Elect, whether it be by giving the first grace, making way into our hearts, or opening the door as it were, that he may come in and dwell with us in an eminent manner, being our Guide and Sanctifier; and to possesse us for Christ, and to secure his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest in us, helping us in duties and against temptations, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king us to strive against our own corruptions.

                  <p>It is a usual trick of Adversaries, to make the beautiful face of truth, if possibly they can, to appear deformed, to stamp upon it the odious name of Popery: but they do too much honour Popery, which do say, the Holy Spirits processi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n from God the Father, and God the Son, is a Romish tradition; for this is for certain more ancient then Popery it self; and we blesse God, that this divine mystery was not corrupted (as many other points of faith have been) by that adulterous and corrupt Church: we do not, nor ought we in duty depart from Romanists, when they do not depart from the truth of the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>Touching the procession of the Holy Ghost from God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and God the Son (not to insist on the proof of that which is elsewhere fully demonstrated) we must not forget to abandon all thoughts of any corporal procession, <hi>ad extra;</hi> or spiritual proces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in created ministerial substances, which are called Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical. Such processions are apparantly no persons, nor are they the very substance of Spirits: for they are, as the Learned speak,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:118911:170"/>Immanent, and for the most part voluntary acts; but here we do mean a Metaphysical or divine procession; in this notion, that person which proceeds is a distinct person from the first and second of the holy Trinity, and subsists by himself.</p>
                  <p>The Son of God doth likewise proceed from the Father, but with difference from the procession of the Holy Ghost.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 For in regard of the principle, as the Learned speak, the Son of God proceeds from his Father only; but the Holy Ghost proceeds both from the Father and the Son of God. And</p>
                  <p n="2">2 In regard of the manner of procession, the Son proceeds from his Father by eternal generation; but the Holy Ghost proceeds not from the Father (as for distinction divines do speak) by way of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, but procession.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 In regard of order, the Son (if I may so speak) proceeds im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and only from the Father; hence it is that the Son is the second person of the sacred Trinity in regard of order; the Holy Ghost so proceeds from the Father and Son of God, that he is in order the third person of the holy Trinity.</p>
                  <p>And what though in Scripture it be not said in so many terms, that the Holy Ghost proceedes from the Son of God; yet is this divine truth sufficiently and soundly collected from Gods word; yea, even from this very Text, because it is avouched he proceeds from the Father; now this cannot be meant of him, as he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Father, for then the Spirit of God should be called the Son of God; but from the Father as he is a person hath the same divine Essence with his Son, and consequently he proceeds from the Son also: and this is more clearly proved from those Texts where he is called the Spirit of the Son, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.6. and where he is said to be sent by the Son from the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.26. and to be given by him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.22.</p>
                  <p>I know there hath been a hot contention betwixt the Greek and Latine Church touching this point, whether the Holy Ghost pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the Son? Yet both sides do agree</p>
                  <p>First, That the Holy Ghost is the most high God, against the Macedonian Hereticks.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, They do acknowledg also against the Sabellians that he is, by opposite relations, a distinct person from the Father and from the Son of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, That he is coessential and coequal with God the Father and God the Son.</p>

                  <p>Fourthly, The Grecians do acknowledg that the Holy Ghost is the Spirit of the Son, and that he is from the Father by the Son; so that as the Grecians do expound themselves, the point of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is not (as I conceive) fundamental; neither is it <hi>magni mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menti,</hi> of any great moment, had not the chiefe Agents in this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion been imbittered one against another by the spirit of ambition, saith <hi>Peter Martyr:</hi> and it is a disagreement rather in words then in sense, saith the Master of the Sentences, <hi>Lombard. l.</hi> 1. <hi>qu.</hi> 11. <hi>c.</hi> 4 Touching this point, I have more amply written in answer to a Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suite, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. to <hi>p.</hi> 202, 203.

I say, that those Christians were ruined at that time, and are now justly in thral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for their sins; but this great evil might befal them as well for their impious lives and base Idolatry, as for their error in this point.

The blessed Spirit is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporeal substance; Might not you prove by this reasoning, that God hath head, feet, eyes, a soul, a heart, because Scriptures do in a far fetch'd metaphor ascribe these parts to the Invisible, Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Spirit, and so infect the minds of men with anthropopophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal conceits of the Great God?

The other Blasphemy is against God the Holy Ghost, inferring unworthily from the propriety of the word in Greek, which is not to be urged in these divine mysteries, that the Holy Ghost by this procession and mission is locally and es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentially present where the Father is not present; for he was not so sent from heaven, but only touching the manifestation of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence by some rare works, as not being at that instant in heaven, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.7.</p>

This phrase notes an order, but no inequality betwixt the divine Persons; as the Holy Ghost is not of himself in regard of his person, but from the Father and the Son, so doth he act from them both; and the phrase imports the consent that was betwixt the first and third Person, as if Christ had said, the Father shall not teach one Doctrine, and the Holy Ghost another, but both shall agree.

                  <p>It is very true, The holy Trinity consists of one God, one Lord, and one Spirit in a Catholick sense; and that the Holy Ghost is distinguished, as in the Text, from that one God and one Lord, and the Adversary hath no reason to conceive that we do confound the persons; yet is his Inference denied, and can never be proved; He is distinguished from God, therefore saith he, He is not God: The Adversary would alwayes get some advantage from the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monymie of the word, <hi>God,</hi> but it will not, nor may it be allowed him; for God is not taken in those recited Scriptures essentially and absolutely; that is, for that one God which createth and ruleth all things, for the Father, Son and Holy Ghost; but God is taken <hi>secundum quid,</hi> in a restrained sense; I mean, for God the Father, as is implicitely signified by the Context, which the Adversary neither can nor will deny. It is a Paralogism to argue from the signification of a word restrained, to an exclusion of all others from the common signification of the word, <hi>God.</hi> I grant, That God simply and absolutely taken is none of the sacred Persons, which would destroy Trinity, and raise up a beliefe of quaternity; yet God as here, being taken for the Father, is undoubtedly one of the Persons of the Holy Trinity; for so it is <hi>modus substantialis, &amp;
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:118911:175"/>Entitativus.</hi> It implies the divine Essence, and a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of subsistence, which are necessarily required to personality; and consequently the divine Nature, as simply such, is not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; and this is the very Doctrine of the rule of faith, which we are not ashamed to defend with our blood and dearest lives, sith it so neerly concernes the glory of God, and the salvation of men.</p>

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi> takes notice, I see, of the different phrases, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>spirit of man which is within him,</hi> but it is not said, <hi>the Spirit of God within him:</hi> but why you have noted this, I apprehend not the reason. To passe by this weighty consideration, that God is a most free Agent, and may speak as he pleaseth. I do apprehend two things may be alledged; first, because of the dissimilitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Spirit of God and the Spirit of man; mans spirit is an es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sential part, constituting, perfecting and distinguishing man from all other things; or at least a chief faculty of the reasonable soul, which is the form of man; but neither of these two are verified of the Spirit of God. Secondly, Because there are innumertable spirits of men, even as many spirits as there are men, and all the rest are excluded from knowing the things of man, only mans Spirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:118911:176"/>him, knowes them very imperfectly: whereas there is but one eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit of God; therefore these two the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of God within him, are but one and the same individual person in all, and therefore it was not needful to add the Spirit of God within him; yet notwithstanding it had been true, if it had been said, <hi>The Spirit of God within him;</hi> both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your supposition, judging him to be but a prime Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for all Creatures are in God, in him we live, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. as the creating or procreating, and conserving cause of them all: and according to the truth; for as the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father, so is it true of the Holy Ghost; he is in God the Father without separation, commixtion or confusion, in regard of the Identity of Essence with the divine relation.</p>
                  <p>Your dis-junction doth containe a full numeration of all the parts; but your application in your discourse to one of the kinds singly and exclusively, is not full, but lame and imperfect: It is true, that all Angels are excepted from knowing the things of man, unlesse it pleaseth God, as sometimes he hath done, to reveal these secrets to them: but that men are not accepted, is very absurd to affirm, for Angels are of a more penetrating nature then men; if Angels know them not, much lesse can men: for certain neither men nor Angels ordinarily know them. Your Inference, that then the Holy Ghost should be a man, hath no foundation at all, no not from your own rule, for singular men are comprehended under the general, and <hi>[none]</hi> is a general word extensive to men, and all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual beings, but the Holy Spirit. Gods own Spirit knowes deep mysteries, be they never so secret in God, even as perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (yea, far more perfectly) then our Spirits do know our secrets: and therefore though none else, (my meaning is not to exclude di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Persons) yet his Spirit can reveal divine mysteries to us; and this argues infallibly his Divinity, and that he is not a created Person; See <hi>Pneumatol. p.</hi> 90.</p>

                     <hi>The reason why the Holy Ghost is in the Scripture sometimes exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of the appellation of Angels, is because of his intimacie with God, and eminency above all the rest of the heavenly Host.

                  <p>That God giveth more eminent gifts to some, then he doth to others, and that he more familiarly revealed himself to <hi>Moses</hi> then to all the Israelites, is no question at all; nor that such men exalted above their brethren, and higher then the rest of them, as <hi>Saul</hi> was from the shoulders upward by a kind of excellency, may be segregated, and that by a usual Trope from all others of the same kind; as to say, the Poet, meaning <hi>Homer</hi> or <hi>Virgil;</hi> the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, meaning <hi>Cicero;</hi> the divine Apostle, meaning <hi>John;</hi> the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour of the Gentiles, meaning <hi>Paul;</hi> is not to be doubted of. I do not deny that God hath used in former ages, and now doth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so make use of the Ministry of his holy Angels to convey the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his will to his servants, which sometimes is known to men themselves, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.19. and 9.21. and 10.14. and to many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers recorded in the Scriptures; and sometimes this Ministry is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and unknown; for these ministring Spirits have their hands under their wings, and do work invisibly both in Civil and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical affairs, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.8. But that the Holy Ghost is a created substance, and called at any time in any Text of the holy Scriptures, a holy Angel, is utterly denyed, nor could the Adversary with all his curious search find out any more then one poor proof hereof; &amp; that is in the first and second Chapters of the Revelation compared together, which yet is improbable, and further from the truth then the mention of the Angel in the first Chapter is distant from that of the Spirit in the second.</p>
                  <p>The examples then which you have brought in as Parallels are not like these under debate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.5. <hi>Peter</hi> had no Prerogative in that matter in hand; so that the naming of <hi>Peter</hi> the chief A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle, the other Apostles are not excluded, nor had he in carrying about a Sister any priviledg above them in the second place. The test were <hi>Davids</hi> enemies from whom he was delivered, as well, though not so great enemies as <hi>Saul.</hi> But neither is the Holy Spirit an Angel, nor do those Spirits ordinarily know the secrets of man. Nor is it any marvel that our Saviour was segregated from men, not only because he was more eminent as he was man then other men, but because he was more then a man, even the
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:118911:177"/>Son of God, who gave Commission to <hi>Paul</hi> to preach the Gospel.</p>
                  <p>These things being urged by <hi>Bidle,</hi> supposing the Holy Ghost to be a person, he doth well maintain in the general the common o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the personality of the Holy Ghost, and he foundly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes some mistaking Socinians, which do deny this truth and do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to be the divine power and efficacy.

                  <p>After the Adversary had sufficiently confuted his brethren in almost five pages, both to prove the personality of the Holy Ghost, and to refute objections against that truth, in the close of all he speaks of the peculiar priviledges and operations of the Holy Ghost.

                  <p>Every Angel, according to the signification of the Name, is a Messenger; but reciprocally, every one that is sent, is not in truth, nor is called an Angel, or to speak properly a Messenger; and he that can extract this out of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> he must needs be an excellent Chymist, and may safely undertake to draw water out of a Pumice stone.

The Spirit reveals, and Angels desire to pry into those truths: the truths of the Gospel are such excellent mysteries, that the holy Angels with wonderful purity and singular exactnesse do desire to look into them, being in a readinesse to do any service for the Church; (an allusion (as is thought) to the Cherubims above the Ark in the Sanctuary;) the Angels look on the affairs of the Church, as the Cherubims did look on the Ark, stretching out their wings, being in a posture fit to succour Gods people: and that which they most wonder at, is the marvellous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God in the mediation of Jesus Christ, reconciling God to man, justly displeased with him for the breach of his Lawes.</p>

This will justifie the Egyptian Monks, which were <hi>Anthropomorphiles,</hi> and hold that God was a bodily substance, and had humane members, because the Scripture saith, <hi>God made man in his own Image;</hi> and because it is said, that God hath a heart, head, face, eyes, hands and other humane members: thus to ground on the letter of the Scripture, is to ground on that letter which killeth: to take that properly which is to be understood tropically, is sometimes to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose such Interpreters to scorne and laughter; as <hi>Cassian Collat.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. records of some simple Monks, which when they had read those words in the Gospel, <hi>He that takes not up the Crosse of Christ is not worthy of me;</hi> took the words literally and made themselves wooden Crosses, which they carried about on their shoulders, not to their Edification, but to their scorn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rision.</p>
                  <p>The Holy Spirit is without doubt the Authour of prayers; the servants of the Lord are bound to pray, and when they pray ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptably, it is by the Holy Ghost, <hi>Jude v.</hi> 20. <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the prayers were ordinary, or whether they were extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, as sometimes, especially in the Primitive Church, some special servants of God had that gift conferred, as the gift of healing &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ng. If they were prayers indeed, the holy Ghost was the Author and Moderator of them; and is it consistent with the happiness of the Holy Ghost to sigh and groan? this agrees well to the state
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:118911:178"/>of the Church Militant, not to the Triumphant. The Spirit prayes, as he sighes and groans; he doth neither of them formally, but makes us to pray with sighes and groans. I demand then, with what face the Adversary could say, <hi>Ours are non-plussed because they say, the Holy Ghost prayes for us improperly?</hi> when he himself is in the same verse forced to acknowledg an improper speech in sighes and groanes attributed to the Spirit, which cannot agree to him that is perfectly blessed?</p>

See <hi>Pneumatol. pag</hi> 90. and so it is true, that the Spirit in regard of the work wrought in his servants is distinguished from God, and we who have the assistance of the holy Spirit, are not the searchers of mens hearts: this is Gods Royalty.

                  <p>The premisses in your sense having been overthrown, the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion falls of it self to the ground; surely we never would contend for the Deity of the Holy Ghost, were we not perswaded that he is a searcher of hearts.</p>
                  <p>You tell us, <hi>If the Holy Ghost searched hearts, yet would it not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that he was God, unlesse he had this faculty originally of himself; but it might be conferred on him as on Christ to know all things.</hi> These words require explication. We do not hold that God hath a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultie as men and Angels have to search, distinguished from their spiritual substances, but the very essence of God doth immediately and without such faculty perfectly know all things: nor do we sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply deny, that the Holy Ghost hath this faculty (as you call it) from another, for it is solely belonging to the first Person of the sacred Trinity to be of himself <hi>Principium sine Principio;</hi> and the Holy Ghost hath Omniscience communicated to him by eternal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession; but your meaning is, this gift conferred on him in time by God as his Superiour. What God may do, is one thing, and what he doth actually is another: Do you believe that he bestowed this gift on him, or not? If not, What needed this exception? If he did, Why do you deny it, and dispute against this his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg?

                  <p>
                     <hi>He that may be deceived, is not God.</hi> This Proposition needs no proof.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Holy Ghost may be deceived, as he was by Ananias.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I answer, by distinguishing of the third Argument or middle Term, <hi>deceived;</hi> A person is deceived either properly or improperly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Properly, when there is an involuntary mistake out of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. For instance, Good men may be deceived in judging chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably that a <hi>Demas</hi> is a Saint and an honest man, when he discovers himself to be a rotten hypocrite, a profane worldling, and a very Cheator. Or thus, when such or such a thing is promised to be
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:118911:180"/>done by such a man, and he failes to make his word good, he that gave credit to him was deceived by him. In this sense God to whom all things are exactly known, is never deceived.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. One may be deceived improperly. When some things Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logically are attributed to God, which accompanies deceived man. Thus hope and expectation are in Scripture ascribed to God, which do not import in him any ignorance of the events of things, and future contingencies, but duty to be done by any in thankfulnesse and obedience answerable to mercies received, which being not performed, Gods expectation is said to be frustrated by them. God planted a noble <hi>Vineyard, and bestowed cost upon it, and he looked for Grapes</hi> (which were but due) <hi>but it brought forth wild grapes,</hi> Isai. 5.4. And the Lord sharply reproves <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> That whereas he had cut off the Nations for their sakes, <hi>And I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive instruction;</hi> But did they not make void Gods hopes? Yes, for <hi>they rose early, and corrupted all their ways, Zephan.</hi> 3.7.</p>
                  <p>The Proposition is true in the first sense, but false in the second; so the dint of the stroak is easily declined.</p>
                  <p>You tell us, <hi>That the Holy Ghost may be deceived, or at least Ananias thought so.</hi> This is a poor proof against the Deity of the Holy Ghost, which a Puny in Divinity may be easily thought to answer; <hi>He thought he might deceive the Holy Ghost.</hi> What then? <hi>Ergo, He is not the High God.</hi> The Consequence is denyed, as though foolish men may not have Atheistical thoughts of the Great God and think to keep their counsels from the Almighty, and their actions from him, that he knoweth them not nor seeth them? The wickedness of men sheweth there are many such Atheists in the world: Thus did this man and woman tempt the Holy Spirit, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. This was surely <hi>finis operis,</hi> whatsoever was <hi>finis operantium.</hi> They would make a tryal whether he knew their sin, and would punish them for it. They that think thus to deceive the Holy Ghost, shall find in the end, that the Holy Ghost was not deceived, but that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were deceived in thinking to deceive him.</p>

This is a senselesse and a groundlesse figment, as though the Holy Ghost spoke not as well to <hi>Isaiah,</hi> in that vision to deliver his message ot the people, as to inspire him to write infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly what he had heard in that divine Vision. Is there any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation of different persons in these to be distinguished actions? And as though the Lord himself did not both? The current of the Scripture is to this purpose without a shadow of contradiction. Take that one place, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20, 21. No Prophesie of Scripture is of any private interpretation. Prophets proposed not to their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors their own sense, but Gods mind: for prophesie came not at any time by the will of man, but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost; so that they were acted by the Spirit, not only in writing, but in speaking: Yea, those Prophets which were not Gods Penmen as <hi>Elias</hi> and <hi>Elish<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And that his coming from heaven is properly to be taken, appeareth by the very sight, it was in the shape of a Dove. It is not said his bodily shape descended, but the Spirit in the shape; so that the descent did primarily agree to the Holy Ghost, but in a secondary way, and by accident to the dove. Is it possible to descend out of heaven, and not to change place? Or can there be any thing better then an ocular demonstration to evince a change of place? If notwithstanding all this, it is yet true, that the Holy Ghost doth not go from place to place; What assurance can I have, when the Scripture saith of any one whomsoever, that he is sent, or cometh down, or goeth out, that he moveth from place to place, and doth not abide where he was before?</hi>

See Dr. <hi>Hammond on Matth.</hi> 3. <hi>Annotat.

But this mission from heaven the Palace of the great King, denotes a manifestation of the Holy Ghost, where he was not so manifested before, or a new manner of his presence, as touching some real o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, whether he be sent into the hearts of his children invisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to sanctifie them, or visibly in the shape of a Dove, or in fie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cloven tongues, which lighted on the Apostles, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.

You believe that God is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in regard of his All-seeing eye: but how do you prove, that his Essence is excluded from being every where? For as you will grant, that God is in heaven not only in regard of his Knowledge and Efficacy, but in regard of his Essence also: (<hi>If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there,</hi> saith the Text) in the same manner is he also out of heaven in all places, and according to his Essence also; <hi>If I make my bed in hell, behold thou art there also,</hi> &amp;c.

But the Pelagians defended their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinacy by Antiquity, as <hi>Prosper</hi> writeth to S. <hi>Austin, Tom.</hi> 7. <hi>ad Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust. pag.</hi> 1249. and they affirmed that none of the Ecclesiastical
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:118911:186"/>Writers expounded the Scriptures as Saint <hi>Austin</hi> did: This might be observed in other Doctrines of Faith: I will instance but in one of them; the Son of God did properly assume the Nature of man, and not man which signifies a person; but divers Fathers scruple not to say, that the Word assumed man, as <hi>Austin</hi> often; their meaning was innocent and found, but they spake im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly and not so warily before <hi>Nestorius</hi> broached his Heresie of two Persons in Christ, as they did afterwards, saith <hi>Estius in</hi> 3. <hi>Sent. distin</hi> 5. <hi>Sect.</hi> 4.</p>
               <p>Secondly, This wrangling Sophister doth frequently acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, That the Fathers of the Church, which are cited by him, were all of them of a contrary judgement to him; <hi>viz.</hi> That they held, That the Son of God had a Being, before his Incarnation of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and he is so unhappy as to maintain an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion not owned by any in the Catholick Church, and defended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by knowne Hereticks, which he is ashamed to name; and it is most certain, that he cannot, nor doth he alledge one Primitive Writer for his Tenet, but all of them are by his own confession a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him; so that our Adversary regards not to prejudice his owne cause, if he can thereby hurt his neighbours; he is farre unlike to <hi>Arius</hi> himselfe, who gloried in an Epistle to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sebius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> that almost all the Bishops of the East were of his judgment. <hi>Theodor. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Histor. c.</hi> 5. those that lived in his dayes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, I will briefly examine all his Quotations set downe in Pomp and at large, and where I shall be convinced that there is a cause, will confesse that some unwary passages drop from their pens; which ingenuous dealing can bring no prejudice either to our cause, or the holy Fathers. <hi>Hierom</hi> answers this calumny, and saith; If faults are found in Writers which flourished before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod, and if before <hi>Arius</hi> as a Noon-Divel arose, they wri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Nor do we deny, That the Lord Christ received his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from God his Father, both eternally as he was his Son, as all else by eternal generation; and in time also, as he was our Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and became man; and in both respects the person of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is distinguished from his Son our Lord.</p>

                  <p>The Gentiles objected to the Christians as a great fault, no lesse then Atheism, that they worshipped not their <hi>Jupiter, Mercury,</hi> and their reputed Demons; the Christians confesse that charge, yet making it known to them, that they worship the true God, and plainly do mention the Father, Son and Holy Ghost: this is a good proof of the blessed Trinity.</p>
                  <p>And whereas this Authour which lived in the same age with <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> yet was somewhat more ancient then <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> saith (as you read his words) <hi>That Christians did worship the Holy Angels.</hi> To this I answer,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. If the holy Father had asserted that the persecuted Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans had worshipped the Holy Angels with the same worship and veneration, wherewith the most High God is worshipped, this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed had been palpable Idolatry, even by the confession of the Idolatrous Pontificians themselves, as <hi>Perionius in locum. Justin. p.</hi> 57. observeth. But this is only spoken Indefinitely without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction,
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:118911:191"/>and shewes, that Christians had then a reverend esteem of the holy Angels in opposition to the made Gods of the Gentiles which they detested, for we desire to render a commensurate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of honour due to the creatures according to their dignity; not an honour as to our Lords and Masters, but of love and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity as to our friends and fellow Creatures; which is of the same kind and nature with that which we give to the most holy and venerable men on earth.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I answer, that it cannot appear that <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> or the Catholicks in his time, made Angels the Objects of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worship. The Words run thus; <hi>We worship him,</hi> .i. <hi>the Father, and his Son coming from him, and teaching us these things, and the Army of the Angels, together with the Prophetick Spirit.</hi> Papists make a distinction, and read in this manner, but without reason, as <hi>Scultetus</hi> hath observed: <hi>Justin</hi> teacheth, That the Son reveales the Father and all things to us by the Ministry of Angels: If Papists reading should take place, the Holy Ghost should be inferiour to the Angels, and worshipped in the fourth place, and he should contradict himself, for a little below he sheweth the Father is to be worshipped in the first place, the Son in the second, the Holy Ghost in the third, the holy Angels not at all: and in his Dialogue with <hi>Tryphon</hi> the Jew, he sheweth that the Angel that appeared to <hi>Lot</hi> was the Son of God, because he was worshipped, which had no strength at all, if Angels were to be worshipped.</p>

                  <p>The distinction of the glorious Persons of the sacred Trinity, and their order in regard of Principal and Original (as Divines do phrase it) is Religiously maintained by us. The Father being of none other, is the Principle of the Son of God, and is therefore called the first Person in order of subsisting; the Father and the Son
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:118911:192"/>are the Principle of the Holy Ghost, therefore the Son is in order of subsisting the second Person, and the Holy Ghost is the third being from Eternity, both from the Father and the Son of God: This order is observed by <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> in a Catholick, not He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical sense. See <hi>Pneumatol p.</hi> 94. 95. Nor is there any strength to alledge, that <hi>Justin</hi> calls the Father, the True, the Immutable and Eternal God; for this is true also of the Son of God, and of the Holy Ghost, albeit there are reasons (as I have often shewed) why these Epithets are often ascribed to God the Father.</p>
                  <p>It seemes the Adversaries heart smote him in this Quotation, in that he silenceth an explication immediately subjoyned: We will shew that we do rightly worship him; if this worship was insinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the precedent words, it is here particularly applyed to the Holy Ghost; and if understood as formerly, this worshipping of the Holy Ghost is by praying to him, and praising him for his benefits.</p>

                  <p>The force of this Objection depends on the homonymie of before and after. The Son is after the Father, but how? Not in time, for Father and Son are Relatives: not in Nature, for the Nature and Essence of God the Father and the Son, is but one Infinite, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and Undivided Nature; nor is the Son after the Father, if we speak properly, in Majesty and Glory, for herein they are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual; but he is after his Father in order of subsisting.</p>

                  <p>The words of <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> are dark, and, as is clear, they are not spoken positively, but upon supposition, thus, If he could not prove to an obstinate Jew and wrangling Sophister (for there are many sublime and divine Truths, which an obstinate Adversary will not submit unto) that he was the Son of God before he was borne of the Virgin, yet do they make nothing against us; but if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the tenour of his Discourse, they do directly contradict. Mr. <hi>Bidies</hi> assertion; for he constantly maintaines that Christ did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exist and was the Son of God, as himself confesseth, <hi>pag.</hi> 38.39, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was the son of <hi>Mary,</hi> yea, before the world it selfe was created.</p>
                  <p>Your first observation hath no ground at all in the words of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin,</hi> and it is a notorious fallacie to turne a supposition into a real position. For certain it is, that the words so resolved, are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to his clear judgement, who in many places proves at large by his apparitions in the old Testament chiefly, that Christ had a being before his Incarnation.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 To the second I answer, It is true, there were some which were called Christians in that age: shall I say with a Learned man, that they were <hi>Catechumini,</hi> or new beginners to learn Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, which were not instructed then in the highest mystery of the eternal generation of the Son of God? Or rather, if I am not mistaken, <hi>Artemon the Montanist, Carpocrates,</hi> and some such like monstrous Hereticks in this Century, with whom you, Mr. <hi>Bidle,</hi> may shake hands, which held Christ was onely man.

We will give you leave Mr. <hi>Bidle,</hi> to triumph in such Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 To the third I answer, That it is not much material what the
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:118911:193"/>blinded and besotted Jewes believed in those dayes. [I know (saith <hi>Justin,</hi> immediately before the words cited by the Adversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) that the Jewes will neither understand, nor do those things that belong to God, but what their Doctors teach.] Yet the holy and ancient Jewes (as Learned <hi>Gerhard</hi> and others do plentifully prove) were of a better faith touching their Messias; nor did those Jewes then living believe that their Messiah should be crucified for the sins of the people, but be a glorious King on earth; and shall we deny plain and most comfortable Scriptures, to gratifie the cursed and the hardned Jewes?</p>
                  <p>I will take leave to imitate the Adversary, and add an Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation out of the words of <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Tryphans</hi> collections from them, set downe by the blessed Martyr next to the objected words, and that he saith also, that he was man of man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tryphon</hi> having made a long discourse touching Christ, saith thus, [It seemes wonderful to me, nor can it be proved that thou sayest, this Christ being God before the world was created, would afterwards become man, this seems to me not only to be wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but foolish.</p>
                  <p>Hence I do observe, That <hi>Justin</hi> taught (in <hi>Tryphons</hi> judgment) that Christ was God absolutely and positively before the Creation, and that not only against Mr. <hi>Bidle,</hi> but the old Arians; that he hath two natures, the Divine and the Humane; for if the Immortal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit had been created before all other Creatures by a priviledge, (as <hi>Plato</hi> and his Disciples do faine, that souls were as Lamps lighted, and afterwards sent into the bodies, as so many Lanthornes;) Or as the Immortal soul that lives in a state separated from the body, shall according to our faith be re-united to the body; this is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther simply wonderful, nor foolish; but when this is done, there is still but one humane Nature. But in <hi>Justins</hi> judgment, he that was God before the Creation became man in time, and so there must needs be two Natures, which Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi> denies.</p>

                  <p>This being named, you make a long skip to the words of <hi>Moses</hi> concerning Gods appearing to <hi>Abraham;</hi> but if you would peruse the Text <hi>Isai.</hi> 40. applied by the Author to Jesus Christ, which is inserted betwixt those two Quotations, you must needs confesse, that Christ is in the judgment of <hi>Justin</hi> the most High God, <hi>Behold the Lord will come with a strong hand,</hi> ver. 10. <hi>Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his fist. Tryphon</hi> saith, [These words prove not what thou wouldst perswade unto.] Then replied <hi>Justin,</hi> [If Prophesies had not failed among you, you would perhaps under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand these things which are spoken of Christ. Can any thing be more clear for the Deity of Christ?</p>
                  <p>It was the true God that appeared to <hi>Abraham;</hi> this Angel was an uncreated Angel, the Angel of the Covenant called expresly, <hi>Jehovah, Gen.</hi> 18.13. one that had power either to save or destroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> whom <hi>Abraham</hi> acknowledged to be the Judge of all the Earth.</p>
                  <p>It was the Opinion of <hi>Justin, Tertullian lib. Adversus Praxeam,</hi> and other holy Fathers, that God the Father never appeared in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny resemblance to the outward senses of any of his servants; but that he alwayes sate most glorious in his Throne of Majesty in the Heavens, and never is sent, never immediately in his Person came in matters of the greatest moment; and what he doth in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of his Church, he doth it by his Word and Spirit, and
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:118911:194"/>therefore the Fathers called God the Father, the Invisible God, and the Son Visible, not in regard of his Essence, but of the visible form, which he for a time assumed, especially the form of man; which (as <hi>Irenaeus</hi> speaks) was <hi>preludium quoddam</hi> of his future In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, and in the <hi>fulnesse of time God was manifested in the flesh,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. by assuming our Nature into the unity of his Person.</p>

                  <p>I acknowledge, God the Son is very improperly called, a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of God the Father, but when the Orthodox do thus speak (as sometimes they do) it is to be understood in a large and far different sense from the meaning of the Arians; for these Hereticks mean thereby, that he, as a separated instrument from the Father, did, and that in an inferiour order of causality, minister to him: but the right believers are to be understood in a qualified sense, that Christ is one with the Father in Essence, and inseparably united to him, as the hand of man is called his Instrument in working: for to speak properly, the Son of God is not an Instrumental, but the principal cause of all works <hi>ad extra.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the opinion of many of the Fathers, as I have hinted in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to that sacred Text, <hi>My Father is greater then I,</hi> that the Son of God may in some sense be said to be lesse then the Father not in regard of his Essence, Essential properties, or Majesty and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but in this regard only, that the Father is the principle of the Son, and in this regard it is, though very improperly, that the Son mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistreth to the Father, is subject and obedient to him; meaning nothing else thereby, but this only, that the Son of God doth exactly correspond to the will of God the Father, from whom he had his Nature, and his Will. See <hi>Estius in lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Senten. distinct.</hi> 16 <hi>Sect.</hi> 2.</p>
                  <p>Or more plainly and fully thus, I answer out of S. <hi>Hilarie de Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodis,</hi> Christ ministred not as a servant to his Master, but as a Son to his Father, in whom is the authority of principle, which is not in the Son; but what glosse soever may be put to such phrases, it is far the safest course to forbear them: and this which hath been spoken touching the appearing of God to <hi>Moses,</hi> serves fully to answer the next Quotation touching Gods judgment on <hi>Sodom;</hi> the Authors meaning is nothing else but that God the Father by his Son destroyed <hi>Sodom.</hi>

                  <p>All these Titles, heaped up by <hi>Justin,</hi> and many others, do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain, as we do religiously acknowledg, to our blessed Saviour and Lord; touching the first Reason, I have in the former Secti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on spoken sufficiently to it. The strength of the Argument lies in this Word, that <hi>Justin</hi> saith, The Son was voluntarily begotten of his Father. The Arians were wont to use this fallacy. Either the Father did willingly or unwillingly beget his Son; if willingly, then he might not have begotten him, and then he was before the generation of his Son: If unwillingly, then he is miserable in that he is forced to do what he would not.</p>
                  <p>To this Objection, which is a <hi>Dilemma,</hi> I answer with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, especially S. <hi>Austin, lib.</hi> 15. <hi>De Trinitate cap.</hi> 20. To omit, that exactnesse of speech is not in these high mysteries to be urged. The Father may be said to beget his Son voluntarily, not by the will of the Father preceding the generation of the Son, but by his will simply, and by his Eternal Will. Thus to beget the Son vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily (I say not freely) is not opposed to beget him naturally, in this regard his Generation was absolutely necessary; but it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to unwillingly; the sense is, he did not unwillingly beget his Son; and therefore <hi>Damascene</hi> calls this mysterious Generation, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>a work of Nature;</hi> and this may be illustrated by Gods Internal Actions. To retort the Argument, Either God prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinated
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:118911:196"/>us willingly, I add, and freely; or unwillingly: If wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly and freely, (which is most certain) then were we predesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated by God in time, or after God, which is against Scriptures: So that the Father begat his Son by Nature, neither unknowingly nor unwillingly, but naturally and willingly; yet not so willing his Generation, that he could, as the Arians dreamed, not have begotten him, nor as if God the Father was willing to beget him after he was God; the reason is, because all the actions of God <hi>ad intra,</hi> are from his infinite Essence; he understands by his Essence, he wills by his Essence, he lives and generates by his Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence; and therefore all such actions in God, as they are called, are eternal, nor can one of them in time be without another. A Catholick blunted the edge of this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> in the forecited place of S. <hi>Austin</hi> by another like it. Is the Father God willingly or unwillingly? if willingly, then he is not God by nature, and he might have chosen whither he would have been God or not: If unwillingly, then he is miserable, in that he is God against his will. And this stopt his mouth, As God could not will but to be God, so could he not will but to beget his Son; and as God is wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly just, good and gracious, yet is he not just, good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious by free-will, but by his infinite nature, and must needs be good, just and gracious, for otherwise he could not be God. So here, an eternal Father must needs have an eternal Son. In like manner the Holy Ghost is said to proceed from the Father and the Son, <hi>per modum voluntatis,</hi> not as will is free, and so may be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried <hi>ad oppositum;</hi> but as will is nature: which we may learn from our own wills, which do both voluntarily, and yet necessarily will that which is (seemingly) good, and they cannot simply will what is apprehended to be evil and destructive. And that the holy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr <hi>Justin</hi> meant of the generation of the Son by nature, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by his comparisons, which are brought by him to illustrate the point, comparing it to the light of the Sun, and the heat of fire, which, as all men know by a natural emanation, are contemporary to their subjects whence they are derived.</p>

                  <p>This Authour, whoever he was, is most clear for the Unity of the Godhead and Trinity of Persons. There is truly one God of all, and he is known and understood in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. And because the Father hath begotten the Son out of his own Essence, and out of the same the Holy Ghost proceedeth; they most rightly, which have one and the same Essence, are to be acknowledged to have one and the same Divinity. And much more to this purpose.</p>
                  <p>If this Authour was spurious, he discovers a great deal of hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie in the front of that Treatise, whereby he would unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably be taken for <hi>Justin</hi> himself: The words are, <hi>We have at large confuted the Jewes</hi> (in his Dialogue with <hi>Tryphon) and the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles</hi> (in his Apology to the Senate of <hi>Rome,</hi> and to <hi>Antoninus Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> the Emperor) <hi>let us now expound the right and sound reasons of our faith.</hi> No marvel then, if not only Pontificians, but Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants generally do not stick to ascribe that accurate piece to <hi>Justin,</hi> and question it not, as they do reject that Book entituled, <hi>Respons. ad Orthod. de quibusdam neces.

And which is more, the sixth general Councel at <hi>Constantinople</hi> under <hi>Constantinus Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonutus,</hi> about the year of Grace 681. do confirm that Christ had two Wills and two Operations; and in the tenth Action the Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of many Fathers are alledged, and <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> is one of that number: And certain it is, that in this Book two distinct

                  <p>This Father sets down the Creed very briefly: The rule of Faith is to believe in one God Almighty maker of all things; he is the first and principal term (as they call it) of all things, and the a-Principle of his Son, and of his actions: and a Christians belief is also in Jesus Christ, as is set down in the Articles of the Apostles Creed, only his Descent into hel is omitted. Is this denied by any of us? Do not we believe in God the Father and his Son? And afterwards he mentions the Holy Ghost: A little above he saith, Christ calls himself truth, and not custom; If Christ is alwayes and before all truth, he is Eternal. This Testimony might well have been spared, being not in the least prejudicial to our faith.</p>

                  <p>Scarce can any thing be more fully spoken to prove the Deity of the Son of God then this passage, if it had been fully related. The Adversary catcheth at those words, <hi>Nothing was before the Son but the Father.</hi> Here is a seeming advantage, the Father was before the Son: But how before him? Relatives we know, as Father and Son, are not in time the one of them before the other? It is not possible, if we will speak properly, to conceive a Father without a child: How then? He is said to be before him in regard of the order of subsisting, being (as Divines do speak) the Principle of the Son. But why stop you at those words? It follows in <hi>Novatianus,</hi> This contumely of the Hereticks doth redound also to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if the Father who is God cannot beget a Son who is God: <hi>Haeretici quasi hominis in illo fragilitatem considerant, quasi Dei vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes non computant, infirmitatem carnis recolunt, potestatem Divinita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis excludunt.</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Are not these words, I pray you, directly opposite to your As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion? These Hereticks were such as denyed the divine Persons, as <hi>Praxeas, Sabellius,</hi> which never questioned this truth, Christ is the true God: which you cannot avoid, unlesse you will deny God the Father to be the true God; for this was their Heresie, they confounded the Divine Persons, holding but only one divine Person, called by several names upon several considerations. So that this passage fully proves, that in the judgement of <hi>Novatianus,</hi> the Son of God was truly and properly God; and doth not your conscience smite you (Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi>) when you cite this Authour, which both asserceth and proveth the Deity of Gods Son by the same Arguments that the Trinitarians use at this day?

                  <p>This <hi>Origen</hi> was judged by many to be an Heretick, and the Father of Hereticks, as <hi>Justinian</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Mennas</hi> Arch-Bishop of <hi>Constantinople,</hi> shewes by many examples out of the holy Fathers. See <hi>Bin. Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>Concil. page</hi> 48. And Pope <hi>Gelasius</hi> prohibited the reading of his Books, <hi>Idem page</hi> 265. And <hi>Aquinas</hi> calls him, the fountain of the Arian Hereticks, <hi>Part.</hi> 1. <hi>qu.</hi> 34. <hi>Art.</hi> 1. <hi>ad.</hi> 1. And <hi>Melchior Canus locor. lib</hi> 7. <hi>cap</hi> 3. saith, The Church was alwayes, not only wary, but sharp
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:118911:209"/>against the Origenians, as bringing a plague upon the Christian Doctrine; yea and the first general Council doth Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize him, as it doth <hi>Arius, Nestorius,</hi> and other Hereticks. This is the Writer of whom it is commonly said, Where he writes well, none write better; where ill, none write worse; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in reading this Author we must be cautelous, lest in drinking down his good liquor, we swallow also his poison. So that albeit <hi>Origen</hi> had been truly against the Catholick Doctrine in this point, the Adversary could not be a gainer by his Testimony. But there are not wanting Learned men which have pleaded for <hi>Origen,</hi> and that with good reason (saith <hi>Scultetus Modul. Patr. Orig.</hi>) as <hi>Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philus.</hi> This was <hi>Eusebius Cesariensis,</hi> saith <hi>Bellarmine de Viris illustribus,</hi> out of <hi>Hireom, Ruffin, Socrates, Ecclesiast. Histor. lib. cap.</hi> 13. And besides some of ours, (<hi>Sixtus Senensis, lib.</hi> 5. <hi>Bibliot. et</hi> 6. <hi>Genebrardus, de Origenis Vita,</hi>) defend him touching the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Trinity; and yet <hi>Ruffin</hi> his Apologist, will not justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Works which go under <hi>Origens</hi> name, which have been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, as many other Fathers have been dealt withal, See <hi>Leci Consum. veterum Patrum Praefat. ad Lectorem et pag.</hi> 68. Either <hi>Origen</hi> himself, or such as corrupted his Writings, laid the Egges, which by the incubation of proud and unstable spirits, brought forth the Cocatrice of Arianism; yet <hi>Origen</hi> in this point is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally held to be a Catholick, having such an excellent Instructor as <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> and <hi>Gregory Thaumaturgus</hi> his Scholer, both which were sound in the faith. And <hi>Athanasius</hi> cites him in an Epistle touching the Decrees of the <hi>Nicene</hi> Synod; yea, and <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dymus Alexandrinus</hi> who admires <hi>Origene</hi> so much, that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braceth his Errors, as <hi>Hierom. Apolog. adver. Ruffinam,</hi> was sound in the Faith of the Trinity, as appeares by his three Books written, <hi>de Spiritu Sancto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The testimony of <hi>Origen</hi> is clear enough, in the beginning of his Works, in his Commentary on the first words of <hi>Genesis: In the beginning God made heaven and earth:</hi> This he expounds of the Son of God, our Lord and Saviour. He made all things in this beginning, as Saint <hi>John</hi> the Evangelist in the beginning of his Gospel saith. And <hi>Homil.</hi> 9. <hi>in Exod.</hi> he makes the Doctrine of the Trinity a fundamental Article. A threefold cord is not easily broken, which is the Faith of the Trinity, on which dependeth the whole Church, and by which it is sustained. In his Book <hi>de prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipiis,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:118911:209"/>Prooemio, He was</hi> Natus à Patre <hi>before the Creation, — and in the last dayes emptying himself, he was made man; he was Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated being God, and he that was God remained man.</hi> And <hi>lib.</hi> 1. in the beginning of the second Chapter, <hi>We are to know, there is one Nature of the Deity of Christ, the only begotten Son of God, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Nature which is humane, which he assumed in these last dayes,</hi> pro dispensatione. In his Books against <hi>Celsus</hi> he defends this truth against the calumnies and flanders of that Pagan Idolater, who objected, <hi>lib.</hi> 2. <hi>If Christ had been God, he would not have fled, nor could he have been bound as a Prisoner;</hi> and then he upbraids the Christians for perswading him to believe that Christ was God. The first Book, <hi>De Principiis,</hi> the first Chapter is <hi>De Dec,</hi> viz. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre,</hi> the second <hi>De Filio,</hi> and the third touching the Holy Ghost, which are the true principle of all things; and towards the end of that Chapter, he saith, <hi>Nihil in Trinitate majus minusa e dicendum est,</hi> Nothing in the Trinity is to be said greater or lesser, sithence the Fountain of Divinity holds all things by his Word and reason, and by the Spirit of his mouth sanctifieth; as the Psalmist saith, <hi>The Heavens are established by his Word, and all their Hosts by the Spirit of his mouth.</hi> At the end of the fourth Book, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>Anacephalaeosis,</hi> of what he had written formerly of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, <hi>As light cannot be without brightnesse, no more can the Son be understood without the Father; how then can it be said, the Father was, when the Son was not? that is all one as to say, he was when he was not Truth, when he was not Wisdom, when he was not Life; for in all this is the substance of the Father perfect; for these, though they are many in our understanding, yet are one in truth and substance, and they are to be understood to be before all Time, Ages, and Eternity, which are spoken of the Father and the Holy Ghost—. These things which are out of the Trinity, are to be measured by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>—. The Word which was with God is not contained in any one place, neither as he is Wisdom, nor as he is Truth, nor as he is Life.</hi> This is clear enough. And lib. 7. in Epistol. ad Romanos, cap. 9 ver. 5. <hi>Christ is one thing according to the Spirit, another according to the Flesh, here he is called,</hi> God blessed for ever. <hi>I do marvel, how some reading what the Apostle saith in another place,</hi> There is one God the Father, of whom are all things, and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, <hi>do deny to professe the Son of God to be God, lest they should believe in two Gods; and what will they say to this
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:118911:210"/>place of the Apostle, in which he is evidently called,</hi> God above all? <hi>But they do not observe, which think so, that as the Apostle doth not so call Jesus Christ, one Lord, to deny thereby the Father is Lord; so doth not he so call God the Father one God, as not to believe that the Son is God—; for the Scripture is true, which saith,</hi> Know ye that the Lord is God; <hi>both of them are one God, because there is not ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beginning (or principle) of the Sons Divinity but the Father, who is</hi> purissima emanatio ipsius Unico paterni fontis—, <hi>for he is not after the Father, but of him.— If then the Son of God be above all, and the Holy Ghost containes all, and the Father from whom are all;</hi> The Nature of the Trinity is evidently shewed, and one substance which is above all. Once more: <hi>Origen</hi> was clear for Christs satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for us, which is founded on the Deity in <hi>Levit. Homil.</hi> 3. not far from the beginning: and in 4. <hi>Homil. in Numer. If there had not been sin, it had not been needful for the Son to have been a Lamb, and to be slain, but he might have remained alwayes as he was in the beginning, God the Word; but he came into the World; this requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red necessarily a propitiation; a propitiation is not without a Sacrifice, and who can give any exchange for his soul? God gave a Propitiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the precious blood of his Son.</hi> Tom. 2. in Marth. 16. Thus far <hi>Origen.</hi> So that albeit (as <hi>Ruffin</hi> in his Apology for <hi>Origen</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged) some Adversaries thrust something into the Writings of this Authour to countenance their own Cause, as himself com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaines in his Epistle to his friends of <hi>Alexandria:</hi> And albeit he was not without his spots and Errors, yet was his Faith for substance sound touching the Trinity.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Arnobius</hi> was an African, and a Heathen Authour in the dayes of <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> and not without difficulty at his request, admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the bosome of the Catholick Church; and to demonstrate the sincerity of his heart and faith, he wrote five Books against the
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:118911:210"/>Gentiles, about the year of Christ, Three hundred, as himself saith, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>minus vel plus aliquid.</hi> He is reckoned among the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the fourth Century. The strength of the first Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lies in those words, <hi>Christ spake by the command of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I answer, 1. That you do deceive the Reader by a false Translation, for the Author speaks not as you do english his words, <hi>under the command, Dei Principalis,</hi> under the command of the Principle God. You would intimate thereby that albeit Christ is a God, yet was he a God subordinate, and properly at the command of the Principal God; but his words are, <hi>under the command Dei Principis jussione,</hi> Of God the Prince.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This phrase of the Father is a Scripture phrase, <hi>Joh</hi> 14.45, 50 And this command notes a signification of the Fathers will to the Son of God as sent, and the interest the Father hath in him; and it doth not infallibly prove superiority on his part that commands, yea, the Scriptures do not abhor to avouch, that the Great God is at the command of his servants Prayers, <hi>Isai.</hi> 45.11. Which shewes only the Creatures interest in God, and his gracious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the Creature: and if these words are spoken of Christ as he is God, they note only a concurrence of will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Father and the Son in the great work of mans Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, This command may respect Christ in regard of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature, and as he was our Mediator: the words of <hi>Arno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> lead us to this sense; this commandment was given to our Saviour as he was under the form of man; and who doubts but a Creature ought to be at the command of the Almighty Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour?</p>

                  <p>Secondly, I answer, These words, <hi>The prime God and Father of all,</hi> is not taken Personally, but Essentially; however, not in opposition to Gods Son, whom the Socinians do worship; for <hi>Arnobius</hi> himself saith expresly, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>pag.</hi> 34. <hi>That Christ was worshipped, and his Divinity adored;</hi> and therefore if we will say, that <hi>Arnobius</hi> is true to his own Tenet, the Son must needs be comprehended in that term, <hi>The High God:</hi> but in this Text the prime God, and Father of all, is opposed to the many made Gods of the Gentiles, which <hi>Arnobius</hi> took to task to confute, and which Gods they Idolatrously worshipped; and the Context makes this construction good, if you (say the Gentiles) had any respect of the Divinity, why do you (Christians) worship other Gods with us?

                  <p>There is nothing of any moment in this Quotation which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us, but much for us.

But we may rather judge, that this is not spoken of the humane Nature, as though it was only in appearance, and not really such: For how could the Authour say, <hi>He was killed after the manner of men, and he assumed the form of man, and the similitude of our kind, hiding therein his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal power?</hi> In summe, he was not only that substance, which to outward senses he seemed to be, <hi>viz.</hi> only a man; but he was more then a man, even God as well as man.

                  <p>This passage is a meer slander ignorantly objected against <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobius,</hi> and that not without a contradiction; for how should a counterfeit man dye for the sins of men? The Fathers meaning, who was not yet a baptized Christian, but a Catechumen or cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized Christian in the grounds of Religion, is plain, that the whole of Christ suffered not, died not for our sins; for the divine nature is impassible; but the man, that is, Christ dyed in regard of his humane Nature. This sense you might have learned from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples alledged by him, which are not (I grant) in all things answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to this of Christ. If a Prophet of <hi>Apollo</hi> be killed, yet <hi>Apollo</hi> himself acting him to Prophesie, is not in the judgment of heathens killed.

                  <p>But I would gladly learn of you (Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi>) how you can make this collection good? They that hold Christ had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>existent nature before his Incarnation, must hold that the Saviour died not, but a counterfeited man assumed by him. Is
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:118911:212"/>this a genuine fruit of this assertion, and that we are ashamed to own a crucified Christ? Nay verily, this is so false, that we do glory and take great comfort herein, as the very foundation of our happinesse. Do not you observe, that millions of Christians do put this into their Creed, That they do firmely believe, that Christ had a pre-existent Nature before the Assumption of ours into the Unity of his Person, and that he was crucified for us in reality?

                  <p>If <hi>Arnobius, Tertullian</hi> or any other should deny, That the Son of God dyed for us, we will not plead for them against clear Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures to the contrary; nor should you ever be able to prove, That the asserting of two Natures in Christ doth infer, The Son of God was not crucified for us; we all of us do maintain the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and do disclaime the later as irrational. But I do not see any reason to cast off these ancient Writers for some unwary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions; yea, I do avouch, that it is but toying and trifling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way precious time, to catch at the advantage of a word against the common, and well known sense of the Fathers.</p>
                  <p>I answer, There is but one person of Christ, consisting of these two Natures: this Person was given to us, and died for us, but not in both his Natures; for the Deity (without question) was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passible,
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:118911:213"/>and I add, he dyed not accordingly to the whole of the humane nature; for mans soul is Immortal, and cannot dye, though the union betwixt the soul and body is dissolved; and yet it is true, the Son of God, that is God by his bloud purchased a Church, and such actions as these in a reasonable Creature are the actions of a Person. I look upon such unworthy objections as these are fitter for children and Sophisters, then for grave understanding men, as they would be reputed which desire to embrace the truth in love thereof.</p>

                     </gap> is spoken of a thing which had no existence by being made. There was a time when the Word was not made flesh, <hi>In the beginning was the Word:</hi> The Word did not begin to be, when the world and time first began; for by the Word all things were created. The Virgin Mother of our Lord had no being at all for the space almost of four thousand years from the beginning of the Creation, and her Son, in respect of what he had from her, could not be in the world before his own mother.</p>
                  <p>Well then, <hi>The Word was made flesh,</hi> say our Translatours; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which is all one with ours, <hi>The Word became flesh;</hi> you say, the Word <hi>was</hi> flesh. These are different expressions, but an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodoxal Interpreter will observe the same sense in them all. You say, the Word <hi>was</hi> flesh: I ask, How the Word <hi>was</hi> flesh? Must not you be forced to say, That it <hi>was</hi> flesh by being <hi>made</hi> flesh, as all others are, as they are by being made so: the Word neither is, nor was, nor is made flesh, but by Incarnation: If the Word be flesh, it cannot be the same with flesh, for there are different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions of them, and the one of them could not be separated from the other, as flesh is from the Word; and yet Socinians say, That now Christ hath no flesh in heaven; but if the Word was
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:118911:214"/>flesh, and not made flesh, then is it necessarily and essentially flesh, and it would perpetually and immutably continue flesh, and it would be an implicite contradiction to deny it to be flesh, which the Adversaries will not admit. Again, the Word was made flesh in the Virgins womb; but the Word, as it is the Word described by Saint <hi>John,</hi> was not made the Word in the Virgins womb, and and therefore the Word was the Word before it was made flesh.</p>
                  <p>We say, The Word was made flesh, because the Word assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that thing into the unity of his sacred person, which was made, and is flesh: and after the same manner is the flesh said to be made God, <hi>Damascen. lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Orthod. fidei, cap.</hi> 19.

The Word (a subsisting person) did not assume the person of man pre-existing, the least moment of time before his assumption, as <hi>Nesterius</hi> drea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: but he took the flesh and nature of man; and remaining what he was before, he took that which he had not; <hi>viz.</hi> he was both perfect God, and perfect man.</p>

                  <p>Nor is it clear, That there is any mention of what Christ had done as man, till the fortieth Verse; to be sure, not till the sixth Verse; for what you object to the contrary is answered by some learned Writers. <hi>He was in the world,</hi> say you: For so he was (say they) in the beginning, and so eminently that the world was made by him; not that other, enlightning every man with the light of reason and understanding that is born of a woman; for he is that true, heavenly and divine Light, like the Sun to enlighten the world; nor the last, which is most likely, he came to his owne <hi>viz</hi> by his choice and favour; all the world is his by right of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but the Jewes more specially his peculiar people, which in a peculiar manner he owned above all Nations and instructed them in his wayes.

                  <p>Your Inference whereby you would bring us to an absurdity, is grounded (as I have shewed) upon a false Interpretation of these words, <hi>The Word was made flesh;</hi> which is a very strong, but not the only Text to prove the Incarnation of our Saviour, for there are many others which you cannot elude; for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. <hi>The Son of God took not the seed of Angels, but of man;</hi> that is, he was made man by assuming the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> into the Unity of his Person. How can that which doth not subsist, assume any thing? Of necessity then there must be another nature of the Son of God besides the humane; and this is necessarily to be believed, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.2. And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> is plain, <hi>God was manifested in
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:118911:217"/>the flesh,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.16. And this is made good by two Arguments in the Text, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. First, because it is said, <hi>We saw his Glory;</hi> What glory? His glory manifested by working Miracles, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.11 Secondly, Because he is called, <hi>The only bogotten Son of God.</hi> His generation then from the Father is different from all others; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are Sons by Grace, and therefore he is the Son of God by Nature. Your Supposition, which was the position of <hi>Eutiches</hi> and <hi>Dioscorus,</hi> related in that famous Synod of <hi>Chalcedon, Act.</hi> 1. That there were two Natures of Christ before the union, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one was made of both, that great Synod consisting of six hundred and thirty Bishops, cryed out <hi>Anathema</hi> to them which say so; and in the fifth Action, they put into their Creed, <hi>We con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse the only begotten Son of God, in the last dayes—is to be acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one Christ in two Natures, without confusion, without conversion, without division, without separation, and that the difference of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is not taken away by the union.</hi>

What then, Shall we by looking on your Quotation say, there is a contradiction in these words, if they be compared with the former? I do professe, I had rather acknowledge mine own ignorance touching their meaning, or reconcile him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self by a favourable construction, then do so. Thus he speaks of Christ as our Mediatour, and of the assumed nature, which in the abstract is not to be worshipped with religious Adoration, for this is a Prerogative due to God, which he taught, only ought to be worshipped.

                  <p>There are very many Arguments in this Quotation and Chapter to prove the Deity of Gods Son; for the first, he saith, <hi>The Father and Son are one God, that they have (simply) one mind and will, and thereupon are justly called one God; and whatsoever is in the Father issueth out to the Son.</hi> Can this be truly spoken of any Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? <hi>He that worshippeth not the Son, worshippeth not the Father.</hi> So that, when he said, <hi>Chap.</hi> 14. <hi>That one God alone is to be worshipped,</hi> he had no intention to exclude the Son from the honour of divine Worship.</p>

                  <p>To this I answer, 1. In <hi>General,</hi> and then <hi>Particularly</hi> to the several Scriptures.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I say, That our Translatours may use their liberty in their Translation and render the true God, a God, and be far from your meaning: What is more usual then to say (they are the words of Mr. <hi>Culverwel,</hi> a young man famous for deep Speculations) You that are reconciled to a God of Peace, and redeemed by a Saviour that breatheth out nothing but love; you that are sealed and san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by a spirit of unity, and have imbraced a Gospel of peace in all meekness and subjection of mind.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Particularly,</hi> I answer to the first place, That it makes nothing for the Adversary, but rather much against him; for these Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauders did not call <hi>Herod</hi> a God; for they saw him to be a mortal man; but they said, <hi>It is the voice of a God, and not of man:</hi> and this differs much from the former, for whether they were the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians or Sydonians, which after a Peace concluded heard this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and like flattering Parasites so highly extolled his excellent Speech, the truth whereof is not now in question; their meaning was, that God spake it by the mouth of <hi>Herod,</hi> as he was wont to speak by Prophets and Prophetesses. And if they were Idolaters in worshipping many Gods, most probable it is, that their chief and highest God was meant thereby. And if it be the voice of his Subjects after the departure of the Tyrians Ambassadours, as is most likely, then doth it make much against the Adversary, for they acknowledged but one only God; so that to them, a God, and God, are the same God, and he is plagued for not ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing glory to God who enabled him to speak in that excellent manner.</p>
                  <p>To the second, Though it is not material what Barbarians and ignorant people do speak in such matters; they said, <hi>Paul</hi> was a
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:118911:222"/>God. And did they not judge him to be in truth a God and not a Creature, when they saw he had no hurt by that poisonful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which did hang on his hand?</p>
                  <p>The third place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. <hi>I will be to them a God,</hi> is opposite to your observation; for was not this God called a <hi>God, the most High God,</hi> and this people a <hi>people, the people of God</hi> in the most strict and excellent signification? Verily he is blind that sees it not. The like may be observed in many other places, to name but one, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23 23. which is in effect, <hi>I am a God not only at hand but afar off.</hi> Exod. 6.7. <hi>I will be to you a God.</hi>

                  <p>No Sir, we do not brag, but praise God for this unity of the Church touching the Trinity, and do comfort our selves that we do walk in the old way, that good way troden by the Church of God in every age before our dayes: And who would not judg by this exclamation that Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi> had found out an Author of great note of his judgment? but you shall hear him by and by sing ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Song.</p>
                  <p>It is a small thing to alledg the Testimony of a few branded He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, which before those dayes most notoriously lifted up their heads, and made a violent assault against this truth in the dayes of that active and subtil Heretick <hi>Arius.</hi> When Christianity was publickly imbraced and countenanced by Great <hi>Constantine</hi> &amp; when the divel was cast out of his Throne, and Paganish Idolatry was much weakned, then doth he craftily and in a rage invent a new plot, and stir up his choicest Instruments to infect the Church with the pernicious heresie of Arianism; and had not the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Emperor by a holy Councel, summoned and assembled by his Princely Authority, stopped that inundation, the Church had

                  <p>I may with reason apply that speech not belonging to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which his Adversaries made use of: What need we any more witnesses? we hear Mr. <hi>Bidles</hi> own confession, whereby he contradicts himself, and makes void his observation, touching the omission of an Article where Christ is called God. For if <hi>Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> was an Homoousian, and held the Son consubstantial with his Father, he was a Catholick, for that term was a symbole used to distinguish betwixt an Heretick and a Catholick: why then is his Testimony alledged to the contrary? For though <hi>Eusebius</hi> did stick at the word <hi>consubstantial,</hi> for a time, yet having explained his meaning to the satisfaction of the Christian Emperour, hee subscribed to the <hi>Nicene</hi> Creed, and that upon good reason; for sithence the infinite Nature of God is Indivisible, yea and God himselfe, it is not possible that he to whom this infinite Nature is communicated, should be a Creature: but he must of necessity bee very God: and did he not as I have shewn) embrace the Catholick faith, and Anathematize every evil Sect contrary to that Symbole? as <hi>Theodoret</hi> relates, <hi>lib</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</p>

Now this Authour telleth us expresly, That his Predecessors held his faith, that he sucked it from his Baptisme, that he learned it out of the Holy Scriptures, and embraced the Doctrine and Faith which others before him had taught out of Gods Word touching the Deity of the Son of God. You might with as good reason say, That the <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers, against whom the men of your faith are wont to ratle, held there was a time (if I may have leave so to speak) when the first Person of the holy Trinity was not a Father.</p>

                     <hi>Eusebius</hi> and all the forealledged Fathers are against Mr. <hi>Bidles</hi> Opinion; which me thinks should put him to a serious pause, and afford cold comfort to his heart, when he cannot by his search find one holy Father to plead his Cause.</p>
                  <p>The Father is the first; <hi>viz.</hi> in order of subsisting, and some preheminence is ascribed to him by the Fathers, in this respect, because he is a principle of the Son, and is himselfe without a Principle: and if in this sense any of the Fathers do call God the Father, the prime God, their Catholick judgment in the main is not questioned by us.</p>
                  <p>Whereas you tell us, <hi>That you never met with any undoubted Book written within two hundred years of the Lord, which asserted either the Son or the Holy Ghost, to be the most High God.</hi> Perhaps
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:118911:223"/>you regarded not all that you have read. But what need is there to hunt after termes? If by necessary consequence this Title must be attributed to God the Son and the Holy Ghost, albeit no such phrase is used by the Fathers, is it not wilfulnesse to require a term and a phrase, when the thing it self is sufficiently demonstrated? Now that the Son of God and the Holy Ghost are the Most High God by these concessions, which are obvious in the Fathers, must needs be granted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there is but one God, not many.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That this one God, is most high.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Son and Holy Ghost are God, and equal in Wisdom Glory and Power with God the Father.</p>
                  <p>Now all these are confirmed by the Testimony of the Fathers which lived within the first two Centuries. if you could prove that the Son was but a Creature, and that the prime God and most High, (in your sense) subsisted when the Son was not, then I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse, you had strongly confirmed your Cause.

                  <p>Doth not this Observation of Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> (say I) teach you (Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi>) that you have wronged the holy Fathers in citing them for your Opinion, because they sometimes and but seldom do use this term, and apply it to the Son of God, that he is the Minister of God? This is expounded by Saint <hi>Hilarie, de Synodis,</hi> your last alledged Authour, to be meant of ministring, not as a servant to his Master, but as a son to his Father, betwixt whom there is not inequality of nature or dignity, but the Authority of principle in the Father, which is not in the Son; and that this is so, your self doth confesse: for you say, He held, the Son of God and the Holy Ghost were coessential and coeternal with the Father; his words in the exposition of the Text do evince it. The Apostle <hi>John</hi> sets down one true God, yet three Persons: To be the Author of grace, peace, and truth, is common to the three Persons; but because the execution of Gods decrees was principally to be done by the Son and Holy Ghost, it is ascribed to the Father, whom the order of doing makes the Author of promising, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of bounty. And concludes thus, [Those things which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long only to order, are not to be wrested to overthrow Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>Grant then that Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> (who is professedly sound in the faith) doth use an unfitting term touching Gods Son and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost, as <hi>Irenaeus lib.</hi> 3. <hi>advers. Haereses cap.</hi> 8. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. and <hi>Tertullian, lib. adver.

Nor was Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> alone, for <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> also on <hi>Genes.</hi> 1. and <hi>Aretius</hi> on <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. do speak in that manner, yet neither did they nor Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> use that term in the sense of the Arians, intending thereby to make them inferior to the first Person, and of another Nature, subordinated to him, and separated from him, as good Angels are, which are sent to walk through the earth, <hi>Zach.</hi> 1.10. and curiously to pry into all
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:118911:225"/>things, to bring (as it were) intelligence to God of the state of things abroad: But they mean hereby thus much only, that the Father in regard of the principle of order, and counsel, is before the Son;— Nor doth Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> positively say, that God is the Supreme Monarch, and the Son his Minister; but he fetcheth a comparison from earthly Princes and their custom; there is some resemblance betwixt them and betwixt God the Father, and his Son; yet he would not have the comparison stretched too far, but writes cautelously with a qualification, <hi>quasi,</hi> as the Father is (as it were) the Supreme Governor; the Son and the Holy Ghost, (<hi>tanquam,</hi> as it were) his Ministers, implying that in propriety of speech they are no Ministers.</p>

It is true, this nature had a just claime to all the glory which God gave him after his Resurrection in this nature, by vertue of the hypostatical Union; and that would have been derived to it by a natural ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as I may say, had not the redundancy thereof been stayed by the unspeakable goodness of God, that he might save us by his bitter passion, which by Gods decree was appointed to be the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent, or in a general sense the cause of all the Glory and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity communicated to him after his Ascension: and now do Angels and multitudes of Christians ascribe honour to him by a second Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, as a just reward of his sufferings, whereby he hath dearly bought us; yet is not this worship acquired in time, and exhibited to a Creature simply Divine, but inferiour to it, as the Manhood, the object of it is inferour to the Divinity: Or else, if this Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship be simply Divine, and the same in kind with that which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited to God the Father, it is to the divine Majesty and Person of the Lamb, for this new and rare benefit purchased for us by his blood; and hence is that Doxology called a new Song, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.9. and <hi>Chap.</hi> 14.3. as <hi>Psal.</hi> 40.3. because this new benefit is a new Motive and Argument with joyful hearts to worship him.</p>

                  <p>Far be it from me to speak one word that should tend to the staining and eclipsing of their due honour; yet do not we so far advance their Testimony, though we have the stream of the old Doctours, whole Churches, and the most excellent Divines to plead our Cause, as to make them the rule of our faith, as Popes in Divinity, and as visible heads of the Truth militant, and to look upon their Works as if they were the irreversible Decrees of Verity; yet are they much to be regarded, as much confirming our Faith, when we discern their unanimous consent in these great mysteries; and we look upon them as good helps to make us understand the only Rule, and we have cause to blesse God for assisting his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful servants to leave behind them such painful monuments, which do proclaim their great zeal for Gods glory, a love to the truth, and the Church of Christ.</p>
                  <p>You call Reason an Authentick Interpreter of Scripture: This is a Title too high for so blind a Guide: Do you mean hereby, (as some of yours have done) that reason left to it self, without the divine assistance and light, if not prepossessed with prejudices and depraved affections, can piously and savingly apprehend these divine Mysteries? There is a difference betwixt knowing God simply, and to know him to be my Father; the Object is the same, but the manner of knowing is different; as I may at a distance know such a one to be a man, but not to be my father or my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; as it is not all one to have the knowledg of a City by a Map, and to know it by the sight of the eye: The former is yeilded, not the latter.</p>
                  <p>Besides, this magnifying of Reason not enlightned by the Spirit, doth too often bring down the Scriptures to reason, and conformes
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:118911:228"/>not Reason to that Heavenly rule, whereupon they do by this light of Reason imagine contradictions in the divine mysteries; for most of their Arguments against the Trinity, are built upon this false principle, that we are after the same manner to judge hereof, and of Gods infinite being, as of a finite Creature; which to san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified Reason is a gross paradox. What saith the Spirit? <hi>The Wisdom of the flesh is enmity to God,</hi> Rom 8.7. And they thought they had good reason, which judged the preaching of the Gospel to be a folly, and proved a stumbling block to them, 1 <hi>Corinth.</hi> 1.23.</p>
                  <p>The Authentick Interpretation of the Scripture, is taken from the Scripture it self; it is both a Text and a glosse to it self; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit our reason (if we look to know it) must apprehend the Truth, yet needful it is that our reason, if we would know it saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, should be guided by the unerring Spirit: that Spirit which breathed out the Word at first, doth convince and satisfie our souls in the interpretation of so much as is necessary for our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>

                  <p>By my Answer, I hope it doth sufficiently appear that you are much mistaken in this matter; and whosoever asserted the Father to be that true God (as divers have done both before and since the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel) their meaning was not to exclude the Son or Holy Ghost from being that one only God; but the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is so called most frequently, because he alone is God of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, and the Son, as the Son, hath the divine Nature and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes from the Father.</p>
                  <p>You tell us, <hi>That the Fathers of the first two Centuries, when not enslaved with Councels, were for the main, sound touching the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> Councels do not enslave men to Errors, but these Councels against whom you speak, are the most probable meanes under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to keep Heresies out of the Church, and to preserve the puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the holy Faith; and what the Fathers in Councels determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, was no innovation, but a continuation of the faith which they received from their Predecessors. And take notice of that loud untruth, <hi>The Fathers</hi> (say you) <hi>for the space of two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, were for the main, sound touching their belief of the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; viz.</hi> in your sense. But I say, you are so far from having all the Writers of the two first Centuries on your side, that you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce rightly so much as one of them for you. And great <hi>Athanasius,</hi> a curious examiner of all Authors, saith, <hi>That the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians could not alledge the single Testimony of any ancient Writer for their Errour,</hi> Epistola de Decretis Synodi Nicae. And Orat. 2. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Arains, he saith, <hi>The Heresie of</hi> Arius <hi>is a new Heresie, and unheard of in former times.</hi> Are not the words of this Writer
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:118911:229"/>of more credit then Mr. <hi>Bidles?</hi> And wilt not thou (Christian Reader) say, That Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi> is infatuated, if he really doth justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and tacitely contradict himself? Mark then how this is proved: He saith, <hi>That the Fathers of the two first Centuries held two Natures in Christ;</hi> and this was their Error. The humane Nature of Christ consisted of a humane body, and an immortal soul which animated his body, And what is the other Nature, I pray you? Is it not the Divine? Can you prove that they meant any other thing by the other nature, then the Deity of Gods Son? This their assertion then, your self being Judg, is against your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession: a sad thing (me thinks) this should be to you, thus to think, There was not one of the reputed ancient and holy Fathers of the Church of my Opinion.</p>
                  <p>Your Reasons why they held two Natures in Christ are false, and foolish, and intollerably injurious to those happy men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Because they did so admire <hi>Plato</hi> (if you slander not <hi>Lip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius</hi>) <hi>that they continued still Platonists in their hearts, and imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced his high Notions.</hi> First, This I say, is false, for when they were Christians, they rejected the Notions of <hi>Plato,</hi> which were not consonant to Scripture, even as other Fathers, which were admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of <hi>Plato</hi> no lesse then the former, which lived at the time and since the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councel; <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> procured the most e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Teachers in all the Sects of the Philosophers; at length he was taught by a Platonist the notions of incorporeal substances; and then he retired into a solitary place, that he might without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption give himself to contemplation, and refine his former No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: a reverend old man (for so he seemed to be) appeared to him, and convinced him, that none of the Philosophers had the knowledg of the truth; the ancient Prophets, which were the true Prophets, were filled with the Holy Ghost. These both knew themselves, and declared to others the truth of God: he counselled him to read them, and above all things to pray unto God. This is related by <hi>Justin</hi> himself in his Dialogue with <hi>Tryphon</hi> the Jew.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I answer, If <hi>Plato, Trismegistus,</hi> or the Sibyls had any knowledg of the Trinity, they had it from the Scriptures, or by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Inspiration from the Holy Spirit, or a Prophetick Spirit, as <hi>Balaam</hi> an Idolatrous Pagan prophesied truly of some things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The Philosophers and <hi>Plato,</hi> (which mention the Son
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:118911:229"/>of God, and that beginning of Saint <hi>Johns</hi> Gospel, <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was the Word,</hi> and proved by many reason, <hi>August. Confes. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 9 and as a Platonist said, deserved to be written in Letters of Gold, and be set up in eminent places in all Churches,) did not understand <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the Word,</hi> which was the Son, in the sense of Christians, namely, for a subsistence distinct from God, and begotten of his substance; but they meant thereby operative rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in God, and being from him, as practical reason is from the soul, whence are the operations of man; which <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> is not a person, or the very soul, or consubstantial to it, but an accident thereof.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. The Holy Fathers were sound in the faith of the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: yet (as <hi>Petavius Oper. Theol. To.</hi> 2. <hi>Praef.</hi> asserteth) when they dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted with the Gentiles touching the Christian faith, the better to perswade them to condescend to the capacity of the hearers for their benefit, spake lesse accurately and conformed their notions of the Christian Religion to <hi>Plato</hi>'s form of speaking, as afterwards the <hi>Catechumeni</hi> had the rudiments of Religion delineated to them, under the plausible Notions which were in use amongst Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers; and so did Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when he would teach the Athenians the Christian Religion, he accommodates himselfe to their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome; for when he read an Inscription on an Altar, To the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known God, he so applies it, as if the God whom the Christians worshipped was that unknown God; whereas this Inscription (as is thought) was not meant of him, but as <hi>Hierom</hi> on <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. saith, of the unknown Gods of <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa:</hi> or as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of the Tutelary God whose name they concealed, lest if his name had been knowne by their enemies, he might be drawne away from the protection of their City: but <hi>Paul</hi> applies it to that one God which the Gentiles did not worship. What can be spoken more fitly to this purpose?</p>
                  <p n="2">2 As for your second reason, The Primitive Christians were so far from regarding any scandal which might follow for worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping that Person, which, as he was man, was crucified on the Crosse, that they openly gloried therein; and they could distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish (though Mr. <hi>Bidle</hi> cannot) betwixt that Nature which was crucified, and that Person which in our humane Nature was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniously put to death: but the true reason why they held two Natures in Christ, was because they had learned it from their. Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:118911:230"/>when they were young; but chiefly because that Doctrine is plainly delivered in the words of truth; the infallible Rule of our faith; and Christians do indeed with good reason judg the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of a Creature with divine Authority to be Idolatry, unsuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Idolatry, which robs God of his glory.</p>
                  <p>I have now by Gods merciful assistance done with Mr. <hi>Bidles</hi> Book, and have answered whatsoever I conceive to be material in it. My desire in the next place is to shew, that other ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers omitted by this Author, which lived before the <hi>Nicene</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod, were of the same judgment with those of <hi>Nice,</hi> and none of them Arians, much lesse of Mr. <hi>Bidles</hi> faith.</p>

This excellent man writing against <hi>Sabeltius,</hi> lets fall some passages which the Arians abused to confirm their Heresie; and being suspected, that he held Christ was only a Creature, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cused hereof to <hi>Dionysius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> makes an Apology for himself, and saith, <hi>God was ever a Father</hi>—; and afterwards acknowledgeth, the Son of God to have been alwayes, <hi>the Word, the Wisdom and Power; and that the Son was begotten of the substance of his Father, that he was the splendor of the eternal Light, and was himself also eternal; for the Light existing alwayes, it is certain the splendor also exists alwayes—. If the Sun was eternal, the day would likewise be eternal.— Now God is an eternal Light without begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:— the eternal Father alwayes existing, the eternal Son must alwayes exist, Light of Light; if the Father exists, the Son must needs exist also.</hi> And he speaks in the same manner of the Holy Ghost; <hi>We do dilate the unity which is Indivisible into the Trinity,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:118911:232"/>and we do consummate the Trinity into the Ʋnity, which cannot be diminished; and yet we are accused as if we should say, the Son is in the number of Creatures, and not consubstantial to his Father; it is falsely laid to my charge to say, that I deny that Christ is consubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial with God.</hi> This is related by <hi>Athanasius,</hi> and much more to this purpose in an Epistle touching the judgment of <hi>Dionysius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexandrinus, De Synodis contra Arianos,</hi> not doubting to pronounce that the Authour was Religious and pious, and that he dyed in the communion of the Church, that his memory is blessed, and related in the Catalogue of Catholick Bishops. Saint <hi>Basil</hi> in his Book <hi>De Spiritu Sancto,</hi> sets down his forme of giving Thanks, which he received from his Elders, which with joint consent thus praised God, <hi>Glory and Dominion for ever and ever be to God the Father, and his Son our Lord Jesus Christ, with the Holy Spirit, Amen.</hi> He died in the year of our Lord, 251.</p>

And in an Epistle treating of the Nicene Synod, he repeats these words of <hi>Dionysius Romanus. There are some, as I hear, which being oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to</hi> Sabeltius, <hi>which do contend that the Father is the Son, and the Son the Father; these do not without Blasphemy in a manner make three Gods in asserting three substances—. But the true Disciples of Christ, as they do plainly know the Trinity to be held forth in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scriptures, so do they acknowledg, that three Gods are set forth neither in the Old nor New Testament. And they are no lesse faultie, which do believe the Son of God to be a Creature, sithence the sacred Word ascribes Generation and not Creation to him.— The admirable and divine Ʋnity is not to be divided,— and so both the profession of the divine Monarchy and the divite Trinity may be preserved.</hi> Thus, the Arian not yet borne and knowne in the world, the Tritheites and Samosatenians in this third age were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</p>

Be it granted then that some Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the Scriptures are called Gods, yet are they not properly so called, as our Saviour Christ is called God; the name of God is not simply and absolutely attributed to them in all those holy lines as it is to our blessed Saviour, without addition, limitation or correction of speech; for he is called God as the Learned speak, both <hi>subjectivè &amp; attributivè.</hi>

And who shal gloriously appear to judg all the world, but the Son of God? Once more, <hi>Christ is over all, God blessed for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi> Rom. 9.5.

When the Apostle saith, <hi>Christ is God,</hi> this satisfieth Christians, (saith <hi>Cassianus, lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Incarn.</hi>) but when he adds, <hi>He is God over all,</hi> this stops the mouths of all blasphemous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious Hereticks, which he calls, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I do confesse, that there are some eminent Divines which do acknowledg, that the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as well as that of God, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly ascribed to some Creatures, because something of God is more eminently in them then in other things.

               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Whereas it is objected, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17.15. It is said, That <hi>Moses</hi> built an Altar, after the <hi>Amalekites</hi> had been discomfited, and called the name of it, <hi>Jehovah Nissi, The Lord is my Banner:</hi>
                  <pb n="422" facs="tcp:118911:238"/>This is spoken, saith <hi>Junius</hi> in <hi>Bellar. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Christo cap.</hi> 7. An Altar is built (understand, to the Lord) and he is, <hi>The Lord my Banner:</hi> Nor is it simply called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> but <hi>Jehovah Nissi,</hi> with the adjection of another word, as pointing at him after a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental manner of speech, who was the <hi>Banner of Israel,</hi> which that Altar could not possibly be, being destitute of life; and whether you respect the matter, or the forme, or the end thereof, there could be no occasion to suspect that that Altar was <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and so there was no danger at all in that appellation; nor is there any Text, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Argument in Scripture which intimates that the Altar was <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah;</hi> nor could that Altar be the Exaltation or Banner of <hi>Israel,</hi> as the Lord is. Besides, that Altar was a Monument and Type of Christ and the great God, who was their real Banner, and not that Altar. And by consequence the name <hi>Jehovah,</hi> is not properly gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Altar.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 2. It may be further objected, That the name of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> shall be from that day called, <hi>Jehovah Shammah, The Lord is there,</hi> Ezek. 48.35.</p>
               <p>I answer, That neither was this City or any other ever so cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led simply and absolutely, but with the addition of some words; and the addition doth manifest, that the City it self was not called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> as we call the City of <hi>London, London,</hi> and the City of <hi>Constantinople, Constantinople;</hi> but another that was Lord there, to put us in mind of him that is truly the Lord; and that he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes graciously present with his Church, which was typed by <hi>Jerusalem.</hi> Or as others give the sense, the presence of God the Father, of God the Son, and of God the Holy Ghost shall be the happinesse of all that now are, and that shall be in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> 3. Lastly, It is objected; That the name of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with she shall be called is, <hi>The Lord our Righteousnesse,</hi> Jerem. 33.16.</p>
               <p>Thus it is rendred in our English Translation, but the word, <hi>Name,</hi> is not in the Original: and to hint this to the Reader, It is printed in lesser letters then the rest, which is the sacred Text; nor is there any Pronoune in the Hebrew, which signifies, <hi>[She;]</hi> nor is there any necessity to read the word in the Passive significati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to translate it thus, <hi>She shall be called;</hi> but in the holy Tongue it is word for word, as <hi>Arius Montanus</hi> doth turne it; and he that
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:118911:238"/>shall call her, is, <hi>The Lord her righteousnesse,</hi> and then the name is given to Christ: and the Text, if rightly translated, confirmes this name <hi>Tetragrammaton,</hi> of four letters, which some do say is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and cannot be pronounced to be incommunicable, and that our Saviour is by nature the true God. It is frequent in Scripture to say, that God calls the Church, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. 1 <hi>Thess.</hi> 5.24. and experience proves it, but who doth or can say, that the Churchis the Lord our Righteousnesse? and if it had been said so of the Church, it had been as 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 12.12. Christ; the name of the whole is attributed to the principal part.</p>
               <p>I shall now demonstrate, that this name <hi>Johovah</hi> is without contradiction ascribed to Christ, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 23.6. The Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels by the blessed Spirit, that the people of <hi>Israel</hi> and of <hi>Judah, shall call a King that shall raigne and prosper, the Lord our Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, a spiritual King, a spiritual safety and security.</hi> He that is our Righteousnesse, is <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and so to be called in Gospel times, as the Son of God, and not the Father, who by his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnesse doth move the Lord, the Judge to justifie us, and free us from the condemnation of sin. Now albeit these <hi>conjunctim,</hi> were not <hi>nomen appellationis,</hi> as Divines do distinguish of names, I mean, the proper name of Christ; yet was it <hi>nomen officii,</hi> and doth abundantly prove that he was simply <hi>Jehovah,</hi> for no creature can properly be called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and be our Righteousnesse. And these attributed to him do demonstrate that he is the true God: Nor is our Saviour called by that name only in one place, but in many others; <hi>Isai.</hi> 40.3. <hi>Prepare ye the way of Jehovah:</hi> if you demand who this Lord is; Saint <hi>Mark</hi> will tell us, that it was Christ Jesus, <hi>Mark</hi> 1.2, 3. And in the Prophet <hi>Zachary, chap.</hi> 11.13. <hi>Jehovah said to me, cast it unto the Potter, a goodly price that I was valued at!</hi> which is an ironical exclamation joyned with indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> hath put this out of doubt, that this was a Prophecy of the base and unworthy sale of our blessed Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.7. with which price the Potters field was bought; so called, either because Earthen Ware was here in abundance made, or because it was an inconsiderable place where sherds and broken-pots were cast, as into a by corner, to bury stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers in.</p>
               <p>He that in <hi>Zachary</hi> was to be sold for thirty pieces of silver is the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the God of <hi>Israel;</hi> for the Lord said, <hi>This is a good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:118911:239"/>price that I am valued at:</hi> But Christ is he that was sold for thirty pieces of silver, <hi>Matth.</hi> 27. Therefore he is the true God of <hi>Israel.</hi> And in the 12 <hi>Ch.</hi> of <hi>Zach. v.</hi> 10. the Reason is this.</p>
               <p>He whom the <hi>house of David shall look upon, whom they have pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced and crucified.</hi> is properly God; but Christ is he who was cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the house of <hi>David.</hi> The Major is in the words of the Prophets, <hi>The Lord saith, I will pour on the house of David the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace, and they shall look on me whom they have pierced.</hi> The Minor is <hi>John</hi> 19.37. and <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.7. and in that Prophetical Psalme of the Kingdom of Christ, <hi>Psal.</hi> 97. Christ is six times cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon this account also it is that Christ is stiled an Angel, an uncreated Angel. In an outward form God the Father never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the sons of men, for no man hath seen God at any time; but Christ hath thus appeared, which apparitions were a <hi>praeludium</hi> of his future Incarnation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18. he who appeared to <hi>Abraham</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with two Angels, is called both a man and <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> took him for both; he is often called <hi>Jehovah,</hi> ver. 1. <hi>The Lord appeared unto Abraham:</hi> ver. 13. <hi>The Lord said unto A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi> ver. 14. and 17. <hi>The Lord said,</hi> ver. 20. <hi>Abraham</hi> yet (ver. 22) <hi>stood before the Lord:</hi> ver. 26. and ver. 32. <hi>And the Lord went his way when he left communing with Abraham: and he appeared in the figure of a man, he walked, he washed his feet, he did eat, and talked as a man;</hi> And this was to signifie the future reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the Son of God in our Nature; and for this and the like apparitions our Saviour saith, <hi>Abraham saw my day</hi> (my coming into the flesh) <hi>and rejoyced,</hi> John 5.56. This Angel then was none of the created Angels, but the Son of God. And this is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest,</p>
               <p n="1">1 Because the Divine Name <hi>Jehovah</hi> is frequently attributed to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Because the two Angels, which were Gods Messengers di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished from him, <hi>ver:</hi> 22. are not so much as once in the Text called <hi>Jehovah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 From his Office and Work. Is any thing too hard for God to do? Can any thing be hidden from God? <hi>Should I hide any thing from Abraham which I am ready to do?</hi> And <hi>Abraham</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged this Lord to be the <hi>Judge of all the world.</hi> Can these
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:118911:239"/>things belong to a created Angel? This storie put it out of que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, that he with whom <hi>Abraham</hi> talked was not a created An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, but the Most High God. Nor is it without great strength to the Cause in hand, that in the next Chapter; <hi>chap.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>The Lord rained fire and brimstone on Sodom from the Lord.</hi> A ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest distinction here is betwixt the person that rained fire, and the person from whom he rained; why else should be added, <hi>The Lord rained from the Lord?</hi> For if it had been only said, <hi>The Lord rained,</hi> it had been evident enough that the rain had beene from the Lord; Is this latter, <hi>From the Lord,</hi> added in vaine in this place, which is not so expressed in any other place? It being so rare a thing, must needs affect the Reader with the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Nor can it be said, that it is therefore added, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie that he rained immediately from himself, for then the Text would rather have been <hi>by</hi> the Lord, then <hi>from</hi> the Lord, for he might do a thing from himself, and yet use the ministry of men or Angels. John 10.28. <hi>I lay down my life of my self;</hi> Doth this exclude the Romanes and the Jewes from being the Instrumental causes of his death? Nor is it likely that the Ministry of Angels were excluded from being Instrumental Causes of the destruction of <hi>Sodom, Gen.</hi> 19.13. for they professe that they were purposely sent to destroy <hi>Sodom:</hi> The Son raineth from the Father, or the Father by the Son; the one person appearing on earth, and the other sitting in heaven.</p>
               <p>It was an Angel (so called) with whom <hi>Jacob</hi> wrastled both cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally and spiritually, and through faith he had princely power, and prevailed over God and man. It is not obscure that this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel was the Angel of the Covenant, even the Lord himself.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because <hi>Jacob</hi> expected a blessing from him.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Because he made Prayers and Suplications to him, <hi>Hos.</hi> 12.4. Are Angels religiously to be invocated?</p>
               <p n="3">3 In that this Angel blessed him. And</p>
               <p n="4">4 Because <hi>Jacob</hi> thankfully acknowledged this Blessing, and called the name of the place where he wrastled, <hi>Penuel. He found him in Bethel, there also he spake with us</hi> (being in the loynes of our Father <hi>Jacob,</hi>) <hi>Gen.</hi> 35.10. And</p>
               <p n="5">5 To put all out of doubt, who this person was that encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred at this time with <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Text addes, <hi>Even the Lord of Idosts, the Lord is his memorial,</hi> Hos. 12 4, 5.</p>
               <pb n="426" facs="tcp:118911:240"/>
               <p>To omit many instances both in Genesis and other Canonical Scriptures, I will instance but in one more; there was an Angel that called from Heaven and said to <hi>Abraham, Kill not thy Son, Genes.</hi> 22.12. and saith, <hi>Moreover because thou hast not withheld thy only son from me:</hi> And then addeth, <hi>By my self have I sworn,</hi> for he hath no greater to swear by: <hi>Assuredly</hi> (saith <hi>Jehovah</hi>) <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast not withheld thy son, thy only son from me, surely I will abundantly blesse thee,</hi> ver. 17. Lay all these things together, which I have here recorded, and it will be evident, that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel which spake to <hi>Abraham</hi> was the Lord himself, speaking in his own name, and not as a Messenger in the name of another.</p>
               <p>Nor will that Objection to the contrary be of any force to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude the Argument, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In former times God spake to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers by the Prophets, in these last dayes by his Son:</hi> by this reason it would follow, that God never spake to the Fathers by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angels, which yet the Socinians will confesse that he hath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the service of the Church? or will it follow that some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times God did not immediately by himself speak to them? Or that the Spirit of Christ in the Prophets spake not? See 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11. Or that the Son of God could not manifest himselfe at pleasure; and be called an Angel in regard of his Office, the <hi>Angel of the Covenant;</hi> and because in regard of external shape he was so ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted, albeit if we consider his Nature, he was no An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel? This is the glory of the last times above all former A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that God now speaks to us by his Son manifested in the flesh.</p>
               <p>Nor will that refuge of the Antitrinitarians serve their turne, An Angel is Gods Ambassador, acts and speaks in the name of the Lord that sent him, and saith, I will do thus and thus, I will not hide any thing, I will bless. For I grant, that a commissiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Ambassador doth negotiate in the name of his Prince, which imployed him about any publick service for the Sate, and what he acts according to his Instructions, is as effectual as if the Prince himself had done it. But mark the dissimilitude betwixt an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassador and this Angel; an Ambassador never calls himself by the name of his Prince, he will not say, I am Emperor of <hi>Germany,</hi> I am King of <hi>France,</hi> though he represents the person of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or of the King of <hi>France;</hi> nor do any call such Agents, Emperor, or King of <hi>France.</hi> In like manner an Angel, when hee is Gods
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:118911:240"/>Messenger, is never absolutely called God or Lord, but the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Lord: And this is also true of Gods Ministers, <hi>He that receiveth you, receiveth him that sent you;</hi> yet would it be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogancy in them to usurp to themselves the name of God; nor are they ever in any one place of Scripture called <hi>Jehovah;</hi> nor are they considered as one singular person, though they be one in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation; nor is Religious adoration due to them as they are Gods Ambassadors, and if it was tendred to them, they would reject it, and teach them to offer it to God, as the Angel that talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>Manoah, Judg.</hi> 13.16. and another that talked with <hi>John, Revel.</hi> 19. and <hi>ch.</hi> 22. and for this reason, because he was his fellow servant. Thus much of the first Argument.</p>

                  <hi>ARGƲM.</hi> II.</head>
               <p>Secondly, I frame another Argument in this manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If the Divine Attributes do truly and properly belong to the Son of God, then is he truly and properly God:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the Divine Attributes do properly belong to the Son of God:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, <hi>He is truly and properly God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the clearing and proving the Consequence, this must be laid down as a fundamental conclusion, that God is in himself a most simple Essence, without all true and real composition; for every thing is either God or a Creature, there is no <hi>medium,</hi> no third betwixt these. This one God, as considered without the Divine Persons, is not a Person, neither precisely Father, Son or Holy Ghost, but the Essence it self, which subsists in those three, and is in truth those three; for albeit God is a Concrete word, as the Learned speak, yet being conceived essentially, it doth not signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the Divine Essence with the personal subsistence, but only with the substantial existence, and is those three only: for it is a fiction to think, the Divine Essence is neither Father, Son and holy Ghost. This subsistence which belongs to the Divine Essence, as it is the Divine Essence, is communicable: Every one of the Divine Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons hath the whole Divine Essence, but not adequately and recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. To proceed, God being in himself most perfect, stands not in need of any qualifications, as created substances do, for their operations. These then which we call divine essential Attributes, must not be conceived to be in God as Understanding and Will, or
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:118911:241"/>at least as Justice, Mercy, and such like are in men, as accidents inherent in a subject; nor are they actually many, and really di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished in themselves, for if an Accident should be in God, it must needs be Equal, Superiour, or Inferiour to God: If the first, then besides, that it is contrary to the nature of an Accident to be equal to the subject, it is impossible that any thing which is not God should be equal to the Most High. Much lesse can the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond be true, for the same Reasons; or else God should be lesse then he is in truth, without the addition of such Accidents. If the last, it is a great indignity and dishonour to God, to receive that actually in himself, which is lesse then God himself: nor can it be conceived how a finite being should inure in that subsistence which is infinite. The difference then betwixt the many Attributes of God is only vertual, according to our weak apprehensions, which cannot attain to or apprehend an infinite Essence, but by framing different conceptions of God, according to the different Objects and effects of those Attributes. So that these Essential Attributes are Infinite and Eternal, and (as I said) the very God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head it self, which doth eminently contain all real perfections; which are indeed many in the Creatures, but all of them in God are in truth but one single and infinite perfection. See Dr. <hi>Chey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi> fully discoursing of the eminent distinction of Divine Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, <hi>pag.</hi> 116.— And if these divine Attributes were truly Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents in God, as the Socinians hold, yet upon supposition, that the Son of God was the subject of them, he must needs be the Most High God.</p>
               <p>The Assumption is proved by enumeration of some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
               <p>First, Eternity is an Attribute which is proper to God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Eternity is an infinite duration without beginning, without end, without innovation, without succession, alwayes one and the same.</hi> That Eternity properly taken belongs to God only, will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed by the Adversaries.</p>
               <p>This Attribute belongs to the Son of God, <hi>John</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning was the Word;</hi> in the beginning of the Creation of the great world, <hi>Was the Word, which was God.</hi> Now if Christ was before the Creation of all things, as this holy Text saith he was, he must needs be from all Eternity; for how can it possibly be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise,
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:118911:241"/>that he which was then, when there was nothing but God, should not be God? A parallel place to this is, <hi>Prover.</hi> 8.22. where <hi>Wisdom</hi> (the Abstract is put for the Concrete, put for the Son of God, who is eminently wise, as he is called, <hi>Life, Light, the Truth, and Wisdom,</hi> Luke 7.35. and 11.49. <hi>The Wisdom of God saith, I will send Prophets.—) Wisdom saith, The Lord possessed me before his works of old.</hi> Ver. 23. <hi>I was set up from everlasting,— or ever the earth was.</hi>— Wisdom belongs to the Son of God, as doth the name of Light: he is called Light, because in him is the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Light; and Wisdom, because all the treasures of wisdom are hidden in him. <hi>Bidle</hi> would make him younger then his Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin mother, but the Spirit of God makes him more ancient then the world. <hi>John</hi> 17.5. Our Saviour thus prayes, <hi>Glorifie me with the glory which I had with thee before the world:</hi> But how had he glory with him before the world? Not only in predestinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, touching the exaltation of his humane nature; that is very improperly said to be had, when the subject thereof is not in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: but <hi>Glorifie me,</hi> by manifesting that glory to be mine, which I enjoyed with thee before the foundation of the world, even from all eternity; which glory was clouded (as it were) in reference to men, by his humane nature subject to sorrowes— And this is further proved by that description of the Son of God, <hi>I am Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha and Omega, the first and the last,</hi> (which is not true of any Creature to be the first and the last) <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Which was, which is, and which is to come,</hi> Revel. 1.8. and 22.13. <hi>I am the beginning and the end.</hi> These Titles do belong to God, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Isai.</hi> 41.4. and 44.6. and 48.12. He that is first and last, is truly God, the God of <hi>Israel,</hi> as the Texts do prove: But Christ is <hi>first and last, he that is, was, and is to come;</hi> therefore he is truly God. Now this description is not to be taken properly, as time is ascribed to us; but it is to be understood <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>; for in regard of God there is no time past or future, for then God should be subject to change and instability, to grow older. These differences then of time ascribed to God, are taken from the similitude of our time, and do shew, that he doth alwayes coexist with all the differences of our time, yet removing all imperfection from him. To this truth Christ himself gives testimony, <hi>John</hi> 8.58. <hi>Before Abraham was, I am. I am</hi> is Gods name, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3.14. The present tense is the fittest to denote the permanent duration of Christ, and that his
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:118911:242"/>Being was not interrupted, as some vainly thought he was <hi>John the Baptist raised from the dead; others Elias, and others Jeremias.— I am,</hi> implies Gods eternal and unchangeable being: Did ever man or Angel without vanity speak in this manner of himself, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle was, I am? The Jewes judged Christ to blaspheme in that Discourse. [Behold (saith Saint <hi>Austin</hi>) the Jewes understood that which the Arians professed, Christians un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand not. Since God is the Author of his own Being (I mean it is from no other) he must therefore have the best and the most incomparable being; and that is both <hi>à parte antè,</hi> as they say, and <hi>à parte post,</hi> alike infinite: This duration is from all eternity to all eternity. Christ is alwayes the same, and his years fail not, <hi>à parte post.</hi> And thou Lord Christ) in the <hi>beginning hast laid the foundations of the earth, and the Heavens are the works of thy hands, Psal.</hi> 90. <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. there is his Eternity <hi>à parte ante;</hi> hence is it that the afflictions of <hi>Moses</hi> are called, <hi>the reproach of Christ,</hi> Heb. 11.26. for albeit Christ was not then born according to the flesh, yet in regard of his Spirit he was the Guide of Gods people; and that must then be, or else how could his afflictions be called the reproach of Christ?</p>
               <p>Secondly, As no number of years can expresse the Eternity of the Son of God, so can no place containe his Immensity; the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent (if I may have leave so to speak) is infinite; he is every where, and hath an unlimited Ubiquity; nor as the Heaven of Heavens, no nor the whole world can confine him in his being; so cannot the least creature exclude him from being with it. <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. Our Saviour made a gracious promise to be with the Apostles and their Successors in the Office of Teaching (for the Apostles were mortal, and dyed like other men) to the end of the world. It is true, that the person which promised to be present with them, was both God and man; but yet it followes not, that he in his humane nature should be every where present, as some do unreasonably infer; for he said, They should not have him (as man) always with them; but by a usual Synecdoche, <hi>I am with you,</hi> namely, by my Divinity and eternal Spirit, graciously upholding and blessing the work of the Ministers of the Gospel for the saving of souls. Again, <hi>He came down from Heaven,</hi> John 3.13. because he being very God, condescended to become man, and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing this his humbling of himself, he was still in heaven; the
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:118911:242"/>reason is, he became man, yet ceased he not to be God, who is every where present; and therefore he being on earth, doubted not to avouch that he was then in heaven. And to this purpose Christ is said to walk in the midst of the seven golden Candlesticks, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.13. and 2.1. signifying that he is alwayes present with his Church, and needeth no Vice-gerent to supply his roome, for all Commissions of supreme terrene Officers do cease in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of the Prince. Christ is alwayes present with his Church, rules and protects her, and continually provides all good things both for the Angels, the Ministers and people: this gracious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence supposeth the essential presence of Christ; he is not person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally absent, when he is graciously present.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>Omniscience</hi> is an undoubted property of the most High God. <hi>Thou Lord alone knowest the hearts of the children of men,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 8.39. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 6.30. This was not only true in <hi>Solomons</hi> time, but through all the ages of the world; for why he should rather know them in those dayes then at all times, no shadow of reason can be rendred. God understands all things in their proper Being, and he understands all things in his own infinite Essence, which is a most perspicuous Glasse: The Creatures are the <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum quod,</hi> which are known, and the Divine Essence, without the help of any species, doth sufficiently and most perfectly represent all things, with all their perfections. He that beholds a thing in a glasse, doth immediately look on the species; but actually, suppose on <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> from whom are the emanations of those spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the <hi>ideae</hi> and images of their persons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gods eyes do pierce into the bottom of hell, and the dark grave hath no covering before him,</hi> Prov. 15.11. The bodies of all the dead which lye in the darkest places of the earth, and in the bottom of the deepest waters, yea, and the damned Spirits in hell are before the Lord; he sees how the dead bodies do consume, and he sees what is become of the dust of those that are resolved into their first principles: He sees also how and what the cursed spirits and souls do suffer, and what be their thoughts which do groane un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der such Infernal torments, <hi>How much more</hi> (as wise <hi>Solomon</hi> argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, not in respect of God, to whom all things are equally known, but in regard of our apprehensions) <hi>are the hearts of the children of men before him?</hi> and Gods foreknowledg of future contingencies infallibly and most certainly, is a proof that he is God; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:118911:243"/>Idol Gods do not infallibly know them, they are therefore no Gods. This Argument would be weak, unlesse God did most certainly know all future things: besides (as I said) he is stiled, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.24. because the reasonable will of man is under God, and he being the principal Object, and the utmost end thereof, can immediately work in it, <hi>Aquin. pag.</hi> 1. <hi>quest.</hi> 57.</p>
               <p>This properly belongs to our blessed Saviour: This is Saint <hi>Peters</hi> confession, <hi>Lord thou knowest all things, thou knowest that I love thee,</hi> John 21.17. Hence is it, that he needed not <hi>that any man should tell him any thing, for he knew what was in man,</hi> John 2.25. He could dive into the inside of a man, into his secret thought. Hence the Word, a Title well known to belong to the Messiah, <hi>John</hi> 1.1. is called the <hi>living Word,</hi> so called, not only from the effect, giving life in all the degrees thereof; but because the eternal Son of God is coessential and ever living with his Father, (as <hi>Cassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Collat.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>Gazaeus in locum,</hi> and <hi>Junius</hi> in his Parallels, <hi>lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. <hi>ad Hebraeos,</hi> do expound it) this Word is also <hi>sharper then any two edged sword, piercing to the dividing asunder of the soul and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> (mark his exact knowledg of all the acts of the animal and rational faculties) <hi>of the joints and marrow</hi> (that is, of outward and inward works) <hi>and he is a discerner of the thoughts and intentions of the heart</hi> (he knowes what we think, and in what manner we do think, and what are the ends of our thoughts better then we our selves do know them, 1 John 3.20.) and as he himself doth professe, he knoweth the works of his faithful servants by a knowledge of approbation, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.13. so shall all men likewise know, that it is he that searcheth the reines and the heart, <hi>Revel.</hi> 2.23. which is Gods sole prerogative, as I proved; for who is he that reads those words in <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. <hi>The heart of man is deceitful above all things; Who knowes it? I the Lord that searcheth the heart and raines;</hi> Who is he that perpends these words (I say) will not yeild, that to search the heart and raines is a property belonging to God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he is distinguished from all Creatures? And therefore since Christ takes this to himself, and speaks of it very Emphatically, he saith not, that all Churches shall know that I search hearts and raines; but that I am he that searcheth, a searcher of the raines; that is, of the affections, not because the reines are the seat of the affections, but because they are most remote from our eyes; and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:118911:243"/>the secretest of the bowels, saith <hi>Mercerus</hi> in <hi>Psal.</hi> 7.9. Or because they are the subject of the strongest affections of lust; how else should he give to every man according to his works? as in that place is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expressed <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23. A righteous Judg on earth will not passe his Sentence on things unknown to him. The Lord requires that Judges should follow, <gap reason="foreign">

So are all, even the most secret things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous to the eyes of Christ; he is a searcher of the hearts of all men, and knowes whatsoever was done by all men, whensoever, or wheresoever they lived before his Incarnation; for he is the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge of all men, which no created understanding possibly can know. To know the hearts of all men is more incomprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible to conceive, then that God should be manifested in our flesh; for this hath nothing in it repugnant to reason, and it is both ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable and profitable for us, and agreeable to holy Scripture; but to attribute an infinite Vertue to a finite Understanding, that is, an infinite Accident to a finite Subject, is an implicite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction.</p>
               <p n="4">4. A fourth Attribute of God, whereof I will speak, is his <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency.</hi> The God of <hi>Israel</hi> is Almighty, and can do whatsoever he pleaseth, yea, and he can do more then he will do; for his will is terminated to the actual being of things, which have been, are, or shall be according to his purpose; for whatsoever he wills, he works; but whatsoever he can do, he works not; nor can any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing power hinder him from doing whatsoever he will in all the world. He which is Omnipotent is God without contradiction. But what is this to Jesus Christ? Is he Almighty? Yes ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily.</p>
               <p>This Attribute doth belong to the Son of God; and upon this account it is that he is called the <hi>Power of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.24. and more convincingly then so, he is called the <hi>Mighty God, Isai.</hi> 9.6. <hi>The Great God,</hi> Tit. 2.13. <hi>The Lord of Hosts,</hi> Hos. 12.5. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel which wrastled with <hi>Jacob</hi> is so stiled, <hi>The Lord of Hosts is his name and his memorial.</hi> Zach. 2.8. <hi>Thus saith the Lord of Hosts, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:118911:244"/>the glory hath he sent me;</hi> This Person that was sent is Christ, and yet is the Lord of Hosts: the Father that sent him is the Lord of Hosts, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. he that is sent is also the Lord of Hosts; and therefore there is no Argument to prove that the Sender is supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour or greater then the Person sent; for one Lord of Hosts can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be greater then another person that is Lord of Hosts. And if all that hath been written is not sufficient to convince the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versary, yet this (me thinks) should stop his mouth, that Christ is expressely stiled, <hi>Revel.</hi> 1.8. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>The Almighty,</hi> and his Almighty works do prove his Omnipotency. But of them hereafter.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>Absolute Power</hi> to work as the Person himself wil work, is a Royalty peculiar to God: It is the High Lord only that can claim this honourable Title, because the Creatures, even the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est of them all are under a Law; and they are as Inferiors to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their wills to the will of their Supreme Lord. But this Title belongs to the Son of God, as he himself beareth witnesse, <hi>John</hi> 5.21. that he raiseth and quickneth whom he pleaseth. And he saith again, <hi>I do give to my sheep eternal life,</hi> John 10.28. As he was man, he prayed to the Father for his Church and chosen peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and as he was God he saith, <hi>Father, I will that those which thou hast given me shall be where I am, that they may behold my glory John</hi> 17.24. Is it the custome of Inferiours to use such language to their Superiors? Or is not the Sons equality with his Father held forth thereby?</p>
               <p>Lastly, It is God alone that doth decree and make choice of some men to eternal life. <hi>Intellectio &amp; volitio divina</hi> are compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under Gods Attributes. Gods decrees, which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as many, are but one pure, vital, Eternal Will, and rational unchangeable act in God, and to speak properly, are nothing else but God decreeing; there is no potentiality in God, but he is glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>in ultima perfectione;</hi> he is <hi>semper in actu intelligendi, &amp; vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendi,</hi> as the Sun is alwayes <hi>in actu lucendi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor must we conceive that we are able to comprehend with our shallow understanding these actings of the great God, but our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions thereof are inadequate to the Object, Partly, from the Perfection of him that is apprehended; and partly from the imperfection of mans understanding: for how is it possible for a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite creature to have perfect knowledge of the infinite Creator?
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:118911:244"/>More probable it is (as Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> saith) that the soul of a Beast should know what mans reasonable soul is, and that a Nutshel should comprehend the spacious heavens, then that man should comprehend the infinite God; and there is more resemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the light of a Glow-Worm and the light of the glorious Sun, then betwixt God and Creatures, for there is some proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the former, but in this later there is none at all, yet must we speak of God agreeablie to our apprehensions and the divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. I proceed thus,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In Deo non distinguuntur, esse, posse, &amp; velle operari.</hi> Gods De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree or eternal immanent act considered in it self, and in reference to God, is nothing but God himself; for in Gods most simple Essence there is nothing but God, and Gods Decrees make no composition in him. But now if this Act be considered as Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the term or execution of that act, or of Gods will, as it hath tendency to an Object out of God, or to the thing decreed; then there are many decrees, and thus they are not necessary, but free. God elected <hi>Peter,</hi> and passed by <hi>Judas,</hi> when it was truly and fully in his power to have elected or rejected them both, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently he doth in time give <hi>Peter</hi> a being in the world, and works grace in him, according to the counsel of his will. This is illustrated by a comparison of a Circle. There is a circumference and Lines and a Center: now these Lines are many, and contrary one to another, and do make many parts in the Circumference, but all these are from the Center, and do flow from that indivisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble point. Thus is it in Gods Decree, from an immutable act, there is a tendency to many external objects, and all the change is not in Gods decreeing, but in the objects decreed. We cannot fitly say, <hi>Deus potuit aliter velle:</hi> but we may truly say, <hi>Deus po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit velle ali<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er:</hi> See Dr. <hi>Hoornebeck lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Deo, cap.</hi> 7. And when God is said to will any thing freely, it is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of liberty antecedent to the Will, or act of the Will, as it is in God, but of liberty following the will; not as if God could will, and not will, or otherwise; or by another act of willing or another manner will this or that; not so, for this will is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in God, and cannot be separated from him: there is no other liberty but that of Essence and necessity, but God wils that things should be done freely and not done. In a word, this liberty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the things themselves, and not Gods will. Some Learned
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:118911:245"/>Divines think, that they do most clearly explicate the obscurity of Gods Decree of Election, and more satisfactorily as to themselves; by saying, That Gods Decrees are not his Will, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, himself simply, but <hi>modus voluntatis;</hi> which <hi>modus</hi> is no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, nor opposeth Gods simplicity. His will (if I may have leave so to speak) freely modified and affected to a reasonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture capable of Glory.</p>
               <p>To apply this: Election to Eternal Life is an act of Jesus Christ: for these are his owne words, <hi>I speak not of you all, I know whom I have chosen,</hi> John 13.18. And this is meant of Election to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinesse, because <hi>Judas,</hi> though he was chosen to be an Apostle, yet was he an hypocrite, and a Traitor among the Apostles: He was chosen thus (<hi>Matth.</hi> 10.4.) and yet not chosen, namely, to eternal life: and <hi>John</hi> 15.19. <hi>The wicked of the world do hate you, but I have chosen you out of the world;</hi> and this <hi>Election was before the foundation of the world,</hi> Ephes 1.4.</p>
               <p>None of these forementioned Attributes are communicable to any Creature, and therefore Christ having them all, I mean, Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, Immensity, Omnipotency, Omniscience, an absolute Power to do what he will, and making choice of some men to inherit eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, I may fairly conclude, that he is God.</p>

And this cannot be meant of any coming of the Father, for then it would rather have been said, the voice of Christ, then of <hi>John the Baptist;</hi> for Christ in the wildernesse did more fully preach repentance, then <hi>John the Baptist</hi> did.

               <p>And in the next verse after this voice, and this way prepared, <hi>The glory of the Lord shal be revealed to all flesh:</hi> What glory of the Lord was revealed after the preaching of <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> but the <hi>glory of Christ made flesh and dwelling amongst us?

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He who was foretold by the Prophet</hi> Isaiah, <hi>to be a stone of stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, and a Rock of offence, is the true God:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Christ is the Person foretold by</hi> Isaiah <hi>to be a stone of stumbling: And</hi> therefore, <hi>He is God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.34. <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.30, 31. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.8. And this is agreeable to the scope of the words, which was to take off the scandal at the incredulity and rejection of the Jewes, which had so often (by the Prophets) the Messias promised to them, and yet when he came they owned him not, but put him to a shameful death. But now what pious man can be scandalized hereat, when he reads, that this was many ages before foretold by the Prophet <hi>Isaiah,</hi> who is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <hi>ARGƲM.</hi> IV.</head>
               <p>A fourth Argument to prove the Deity of our blessed Saviour, is drawne from the Relation betwixt his sacred Person and God the Father; he is the Son of God. Nor let any subtil Adversary think to cut the sinewes of this reason, by objecting to us, That it is no marvel that Christ should be called the Son of God, for the holy Angels are described by that relative Title, they are called <hi>the Sons of God,</hi> Job 1.6. and 38 7. because they resemble him in their qualities, as in Power, Dignity, Spirituality and in Holiness, and do not serve him as Slaves do their Masters, but as Sons do o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their Fathers, both willingly and readily, and they are honored also with the priviledges of Sons, being alwayes neer him, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the happinesse continually to behold his glorious face; and not only have those heavenly Creatures, but all the faithful also this great priviledge graciously conferred on them to be the Sons of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 12. This I grant, yet this weakens not the strength of my Argument; for albeit the holy Angels and faithful ones are the sons of God, yet are they not so the sons of God, not sons in the same kind as our Saviour is Gods Son. The Angels re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this honour by grace in the day of their Creation, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God had this grace conferred on them to be the Sons of God in the day of their Regeneration, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence they are improperly called, the Sonnes of God. But Christ is Gods Son by generation, and this generation is a most proper generation. Christ hath taught us to say, <hi>Our Father which art in Heaven,</hi> but he himself never useth this forme of speech; sometimes he calls him <hi>the Father,</hi> sometimes
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:118911:248"/>
                  <hi>My Father,</hi> sometimes, <hi>Your Father,</hi> but never including us, saith he, <hi>Our Father:</hi> he makes no such conjunction of us to himself, as to make no distinction betwixt us and himself. That imperfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which cleaves to the generation of Creatures, is as a defect removed from God; and what is perfect in that natural work is eminently ascribed to him, See <hi>Zanch. de tribus Elohim, par.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</p>
               <p>First, It belongs not to the transcendent excellencie of God the Father to give the same specifical nature to his Son, as is done by a created Father, but the same numerical Essence, which none but God can do.</p>
               <p>Secondly, The Father communicates his Essence to his Son, not in time, but from all eternity; whereas the Nature of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect Creatures in comparison of God, is so weak, that they cannot generate the like in kind, till they are grown to strength of body.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Nor is the generation a transient act of God the Father begetting a Son without him, as it is for certain in all generating substances.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Neither is it done by efflux, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that which is begotten is not separated from the Father that doth beget his Son; whereas this separation is visible in all the Creatures.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The Father and the Son are <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, they have the same individual substance, they are not <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, of a like substance; the Father begets the Son without change or motion, after a most glorious and wonderful manner wirhin himself, and essentially one with himself; and therefore albeit he is the Son of <hi>David</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the flesh, as the holy Word distinguisheth, yet is he the Lord of <hi>David</hi> by his Eternal Spirit.</p>
               <p n="6">6 This relation is coaeval with the Essence: as he is alwayes God, so is he alwayes Son; but such is the fluctuant condition of humane generation, and of relations which arise from thence, that he which is this day a Son, may be to morrow a Father, and the next day, without any real alteration in himself, be neither son by the death of his Father, nor father by the death of his son: But in the Divine Nature it is otherwise, the Father was never Son, nor the Son Father, but fixed.</p>
               <p>The truth of this assertion is manifest, because he is said to be
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:118911:249"/>begotten of his Father this day; this day is the day of Eternity, <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.7. This is a Title too high and sublime for the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels: it is not said in Scripture touching them, <hi>This day have I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten you.</hi> Micah 5.2. <hi>The goings forth of him that shall be Ruler in Israel, have been of old from everlasting,</hi>

               <p>He is called the <hi>only begotten Son of God,</hi> John 1.18. and 3.16. <hi>Herein appeared the love of God towards us, because God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him,</hi> 1 John 4.9. If he be begotten, he is not made, not created: if he be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of his Father, he is of the same substance with his Father; if he be the only begotten Son of God, it is in regard of a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent manner of being his Son, then in men or Angels, and that is, he is a Son of God by Nature, and not in regard of excellency of parts and gifts, for <hi>magis &amp; minus non variant speciem.</hi> If a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther have a son which hath a more excellent Office and better gifts then the rest of his children, these do not denominate him to be an only begotten Son, or more truly a man then the other sons; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are not called Gods proper sons, Gods only begotten Son, sons of their Fathers owne substance.</p>
               <p>These limitations do hold forth a peculiarity and propriety which Christ the Son of God hath above all other Sons, and for the same reason is also called the <hi>first borne of every creature,</hi> Col. 1.15. As man he was a creature, but as God he was before every Creature: And there is a difference betwixt Christ the first born, and others in Scripture called the first born; for 1. the first borne amongst men is of the same kind with those in regard of whom he is called the first born; but it is otherwise here, for Christ is not of
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:118911:249"/>the same kind with the holy Angels. 2. He that is first borne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst men is so called, because they in regard of whom he is the first born, be also borne too; and so are not Angels, in regard of whom Christ is chiefly the first borne. 3 The first borne is not a cause of those in respect of whom he is called the first born, as the first begotten and borne son is not the cause of his, brethren; but all things were created by Christ, as it followes in the Text.</p>
               <p>Observe moreover, to clear this point, that Christ is called <hi>the Image,</hi> (the substantial image) <hi>of his Fathers Person,</hi> Heb. 1.5. When we look upon a Perspective Glasse, our Image like our selves is naturally produced. <hi>Bellar. Explicat. Doctr. Christi, cap.</hi> 18. So when God with the eye of his understanding, beholds (if I may have leave so to speak) the glasse of the divine nature from everlasting to everlasting, there results the son, an essential image of himself; this is an immanent act, called <hi>generatio,</hi> which is <hi>prima ac multiplicativa processio,</hi> as <hi>spiratio</hi> is called, <hi>secunda &amp; completiva processio:</hi> And as the Understanding in order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is before the Will, so is the first production by the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing <hi>&amp; ad modum intellectus,</hi> as touching the original, before the second production of the Holy Ghost, which is <hi>ad modum vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntatis,</hi> and there is no further procession. Hence is the Son cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>Gods Image,</hi> and not the Holy Ghost, because in this he is more like to the first Person, then the third, because he with the Father communicates the divine Essence to the Holy Ghost <hi>per modum spirationis.</hi> And as the Son is the image of his Father, so is he also said to be splendor, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, a coeternal light from the Father, who is as the Sun: and upon the same account (as the Schoolmen speak) is he said to be alwayes generated in regard of the eternity of generation, and alwaies born in regard of the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Nor was he therefore the Son of God, because his mother conceived him by the Holy Ghost in a most rare and singular way: that <hi>Because, Luke</hi> 1.35. refers not to the Conception of Christ, as the cause of the divine Sonship, for he was the Son of God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Incarnation; but it is referred to the fulfilling of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie recorded <hi>Isai.</hi> 7.14: nor doth the Text say, therefore he shall be the Son of God, but <hi>therefore shall he be called,</hi> that is, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared and manifested hereby to be the Son of God.</p>
               <pb n="446" facs="tcp:118911:250"/>
               <p n="2">2 Nor was he called the Son of God, because he was sanctified by the Holy Ghost, and had in our Nature gifts given to him with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out measure to qualifie him to be our Saviour, <hi>John</hi> 10.35. for he was the Son of God before he was the son of <hi>Mary;</hi> and his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing annointed with gifts above his fellowes, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. was to enable him to be a perfect Mediatour to reconcile us to God. And that Chapter plainly proves his Deity, before his assumed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Nor was he called the Son of God, because of Gods special love to him above all others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.17. He was indeed <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>the Son of his love,</hi> but he was not therefore his Son, because he was dearly beloved; but because he was his only begotten Son, equal to himself, and the expresse Image of his person, therefore he dearly loved him.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Nor was he called primarily the Son of God, because of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from the dead to dye no more, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.33. As <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> and others raised by our Saviour did dye again and see corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for evident it is, that he was the Son of God before his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. And his divine Sonship was vailed for a time under the form of a servant; but by the manner of his Resurrection which was by his own power, he was declared to be the Son of God <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Nor lastly, is he the Son of God because of his exaltation in heaven far above all Angels, for he was often so called before that time, and the position of this cause would be the exclusion of the former. That in <hi>Psal.</hi> 2. <hi>This day have I begotten thee,</hi> is often cited in the new Testament, to teach us (as Dr. <hi>Cheynel</hi> hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely observed) to fix our eyes on the Divine Sonship of Christ, when ever we meditate or discourse of his Conception, of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable gifts in time bestowed on him, on his Birth, Transfigurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Resurrection and Exaltation to Glory, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. of the <hi>Divine Trin-Ʋnity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If then none of the former recited particulars were the causes why Christ was the Son of God, as they were not, there remaineth but this one, that he must needs be the natural Son of God, and by that divine way of the Fathers communicating his divine Essence by eternal generation: And this may be further proved; The Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle that God the Father gives him by calling him his Son, this is a Title which advanceth Christ above all Creatures. And as
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:118911:250"/>the Father, so Christ calls himself the Son of God, <hi>John</hi> 5.18. as never man did in Scripture: now the Jewes were not so blind, but they understood these two Titles, to be the Son of God, and God, to be all one; and for his saying, that God was his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and hereby equalizing himself to God, they would have sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him, and they judged that Christ blasphemed in that he called God his Father, and made himself God, <hi>John</hi> 10.33, 34. This must of necessity be understood of Gods Son in regard of his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head: for to be the Son of God by grace of Creation or Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to call God Father in a general way, is a usual phrase in Scripture, and they would have heard this language without any offence at all: It appears then, that Christ alledged his Sonship ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Godhead. And observe further, that our Saviour did not excuse his speech, though it was offensive to them: And <hi>Nathaneel</hi> discovered Christ by his Omniscience to be God, and his expressions no doubt were sutable to his apprehensions, giving him this Title to be the Son of God, <hi>John</hi> 1.49. which in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was as high as to be God. And the High Priest asked him, when he was arraigned before him, <hi>Art thou the Christ the Son of the Blessed?</hi> Mark 14.61. this Answer was present and positive, <hi>I am Gods Son:</hi> the High Priest hearing this profession, rent his cloathes, which for the dead he might not do, and conceived this to be blasphemy; which surely, had he not judged it a Title equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to his being God, he would not have done it, if his being the Son of God had been no higher a Title then is compatible to a Creature; and then passing his owne sentence, he saith, <hi>What need we any further witnesses?</hi> And asking the people, they also said, <hi>What need we any further Witnesses? for we our selves have heard out of his own mouth, that he professeth himself to be the Son of God;</hi> they all condemned him to be guilty of death, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.64. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.70, 71. Whereby they committed the greatest sin in it selfe that could be committed, and that was <hi>Deicidium;</hi> so far as they were able, they did murther God, which must needs imply, that they did not take that his confession to be meant of a Son by Grace, but by Nature, and that he was very God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>

               <p>A fifth Argument to prove the Deity of our blessed Saviour is this, <hi>Because we are enjoyned in Gods holy Word, to worship him with that Religious Adoration (with that honour I mean) which is properly and solely due to the living God, and to him alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now for certain, Divine honour is not to be yeilded to the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Christ, as it is considered in it self, and abstracted from the Deity, but to the whole Person, to the Deity and Humanity hypostatically united; for neither doth the grace of Union nor the grace of Unction, confer more honour upon the Humanity, then a Creature is capable of: Divine Excellency, infinite Majesty, and uncreated perfection, are the formal and adequate ground of divine Worship; nor <hi>will the Lord give this his glory to another, Isaiah</hi> 42.8. and 48.11. It is true, God will give glory to those which believe in Christ, which is happinesse and eternal life; which is called the glory of God, because it is a most excellent condition, and God alone is the Authour and Giver of it. But the glory which he will give to no other, consists in the Honour, Worship, and Adoration due to God, and his most glorious Attributes, for which this Worship is due to God. This his glory he will not give to Angels, to men, to any Creature; nor can it be said, that glory is due to any but God, as to the prime Authour of all good, but as they are Instruments under him, subordinate to him, and dependant on him, as all Creatures are in regard of their Being and Operations. For this assertion makes this solemn protestation of God to be of no effect, yea, and to imply a contradiction, as though God could give his glory to another, not depending on him, and subordinate to him, or as if Gods glory was given to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Creature, it was not given to another. Shall we say, that the Effect is not another thing from the Cause, the Subjects from the King, albeit they do depend on them? And to speak the Truth, it is not possible for God to give, or a Creature to be capable to receive his glory; nor can that Creature possibly be the first Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour of good things, which is the receiver in time of all good things; but now Christ having this glory of God, is not another thing from him, but one and the same God.</p>
               <pb n="449" facs="tcp:118911:251"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>God gave not his glory to another thing:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But God gave his glory to Christ:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>He is not another thing, but the same with God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is agreeable to the Socinian Catechisme, and the exposition of the first Commandment, which containeth these two things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That God is to be our God, and he is to worshipped by us with Divine Worship. And</p>
               <p n="2">2 That no other besides him is to be worshipped with Divine Worship and Honour. If no other is to be acknowledged and worshipped with Divine Worship, then are we forbidden to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship any Creature with divine Worship, tending thereby to the Worship of the great God, which is a pretence of Idolaters. If a King shall say thus to his Subjects. you shall acknowledg me alone whilst I live to be your King. Or if a husband shall say to his wife, Thou shalt have no other Husband whiles I do live; are they to be taken in this sense, you shall have no King nor Husband which is not subordinated to me? Nor was there under the Legal Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation any such subordinate Gods: But the Israelites took the words, as there was cause to do, without any such distinction. And this being a Moral Law, it doth perpetually bind men, not under the Law, but under the Gospel to obey it.</p>
               <p>But it is no breach of the first Commandment; it is no Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry to yeild Religious Worship to our Saviour. all men must ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Son of God as they do honour the Father, and he which <hi>honoureth not the Son which is sent, honoureth not the Father which sent him,</hi> John 5.23. And therefore it was no fault in him, (nor could he commit any) to equalize himself with God; but great hypocrisie in them to pretend a great deal of zeal to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and yet to despise and disparage his Son.</p>
               <p>I do believe, that Christ our Mediator, God and man, is to be honoured, not only as he is the only begotten Son of God, but as he is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>God-man:</hi> The Exaltation of our blessed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour after his Passion and glorious Resurrection, was only in regard of the humane Nature, which the Son of God assumed into the Unity of his Person, in which regard it is said, that God, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, graciously communicated, and freely bestowed glory on him, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.10. But if we look upon the divine nature in that consideration, he was not a Usurper, in that he equalized himselfe with God the Father; and this glory he had not by Grace, but by
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:118911:252"/>the necessity of nature from all eternity, according to his heavenly Prayer, <hi>O Father glorifie me now with thine own self with the glory I had with thee before the world was,</hi> John 17.5. Although the open use thereof for a time (according to the will of his heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) was not manifested to the world, yet having right by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he might alwayes have challenged the same, and he might have spoken hereof as he did of his life. <hi>I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it up again,</hi> John 10.17. For Christ vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily took upon him the form of a servant and was crucified, when he could have rescued himself out of danger of death by his own power, and with many Legions of Angels, which were all of them at his command; yet he freely offered up himself to be a Propitiatory Sacrifice for our salvation, and afterwards he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes his former glory, a short time vailed in our flesh in the state of his humiliation; and the glory of Christ which followed his pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as it had reference to the humane nature, was not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory, though it is neerest to it, and as great as that Nature was capable of, and far above the glory of the highest Angels; yet is not this glory in it self considered, a Cause why Christ is to he adored by us; but this nature is (as it were) an assumed part of that Person, which is the object of Religious Adoration. Now because the Divine Nature is joyned with the Humane in one Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son; upon this account it is, that our Mediator is not worshipped with two kinds of Worship Divine, but only with one; in which the formal object, or the term (as the Schoolmen speak) of this divine Worship is only the Divine Nature, and the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is as an adjunct to that Person which is to be worshipped, <hi>Synod. Ephes. Tom.</hi> 1. <hi>Concil. Can.</hi> 4. <hi>Anathematismo Cyrilli octavo.</hi> As that Honour which is due to a King and a man, had they been divers subjects, would not have been the same in degree to both, yet he being but one person, the honour is but one which is exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the King.</p>
               <p>There are divers honours which are Gods peculiars, and they do all of them belong to Jesus Christ.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The first is. <hi>Religious Worship</hi> in spirit, which is the exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that Reverence and Worship which is due to the great God, in all places, at all times, and in all things; and this Spiritual Worship is Gods Prerogative, peculiarly due to him, whereby we do first apprehend his transcendent Excellency; and this is an act
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:118911:252"/>of the Understanding. Secondly, It is an act of the Will, whereby we do something to his honour, to testifie our acknowledgment of his greatnesse, and our subjection to him, as being the everliving God, the Creator and Governour of all things, and Authour of all that is good; outwardly by actions to testifie his Superiority over us, and our Inferiority to him, as to bow and use reverent ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stures with our bodies in our Devotions, to testifie that the mind and heart do acknowledg the glorious Person which is worshipped, to be very God.</p>
               <p>We honour the blessed Saints, but we do not worship or adore them or any Creature, neither Saint nor Angel, a practise as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenish, and condemned by Saint <hi>Paul, Col.</hi> 2.18. as having no other ground for this Devotion but the carnal fantasie of Idolaters: These misled people, condemned by a Councel of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> as <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doret</hi> reports on the Text, did not think the Angels to be Gods, or equal to the most High God, neither did they worship them in such sorts as to ascribe infinite greatness to them; but Worship was directed to them in an inferiour and lower degree, because they thought they were gratious with God▪ and mediated betwixt God and man in a very high degree and excellent manner; yet were these Hereticks for thus worshipping Creatures, condemned, because this spiritual Worship is restrained to infinite Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>But this Spiritual Worship is to be exhibited to our Lord Christ, whose excellency appeareth not only here and there and in a limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted time and confined place; but presents it self to the holy ones in every thing, in every time and place; in so much that the holy Angels which refused to be worshipped themselves, yet these Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures excellent in power and dignity, are exhorted all of them to worship him, <hi>Psal.</hi> 97.7. <hi>Worship him all ye Gods,</hi> that is, Angels, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> expounds it, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1. And Saint <hi>John, Revel.</hi> 1.6. a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribes to our Saviour and Redeemer, <hi>Glory and Dominion for ever and ever;</hi> which is as much as we can render to God the Father, the eternal God, and which is as much as Christ himself teacheth us to attribute to his Father in heaven (if Father be taken perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally) <hi>Matth.</hi> 6 13. thus, <hi>Revel.</hi> 5.13. <hi>I heard every creature which is in heaven, and which is on earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the Sea, and all of them heard I saying, Blessing, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Glory and Power be unto him that sitteth upon the Throne, and
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:118911:253"/>unto the Lamb for ever.</hi> How can all Creatures, not one excepted, give glory to the Lamb? Not by their words, for some of them cannot speak; but as voices are to them which can speak, so by a Metaphor are faculties and operations to other things: and as words are signes of the mind by institution, so are actions by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which do (as it were) speak by their excellent Creation of the glory of their Creatour, as an excellent work doth declare the vertue, skill, and praise of the Workman. This then is meant of the Creatures as they are Creatures, that do alike ascribe glory to God and to the Lamb, as <hi>Chap.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Because thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure they are and were created;</hi> as there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Doxology is ascribed to him that sits upon the Throne, because he created all things; so likewise to the Lamb for the same reason; for there is not the least difference in the holy Text be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the glory of God the Father, and his Son the Lamb of God. See also <hi>Revel.</hi> 14.7. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. <hi>He is over all, God blessed for ever.</hi> Which is as much as can be spoken of God the Father; nor can it be replied, that God is to be adored as the first Authour of all things, for is there a second Authour of all things? Be there more Creators then one God? Then would not he transgresse the Law which should worship a creature, but not as the prime Authour of all things; What Idolaters then will not have a cloak for their Idolatries? For many Nations worshipped Gods, which they did not believe were the prime Authors of all things; nor would the Divel desire thus to be worshipped by Christ; for he boasted, <hi>All the Kingdomes of the earth and their glory were given him,</hi> Matth. 4. yet Christ repelled this temptation by the Law, <hi>Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God,</hi> Luke. 4.8. Nor did <hi>Cornelius</hi> believe that <hi>Peter</hi> was the first Author of all things, yet did wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him, and he refused it, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. Nor did <hi>John</hi> take the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel for God, who manifestly declared himself to be a servant of God, and when he would have worshipped him, he rejected that honour with indignation, <hi>See thou do it not:</hi> and he insinuates the command, <hi>Worship God;</hi> implying that God only is to be worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with Religious Adoration.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The High God alone is the object of <hi>Religious Invocation.</hi> We are both commanded and encouraged to make our requests known unto him. <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble,</hi> (and by the same rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son at all other times) and it is enforced by this strong Motive, <hi>I
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:118911:253"/>will hear thee; i.</hi> grant thy requests, <hi>Psal.</hi> 50.15. But we are no where commanded nor incouraged to pray unto any Creature; This Religious Worship is an honour which God would not have exhibited to the work of his own hands; for no revealed excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency, (for ought we can learn) can either see, or know, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termeddle with all our particular affaires, nor do they ordinarily know our hearts, which are open only to Gods eye; nor with what affections and intentions our prayers are directed to them; nor can they possibly at once receive them, which have many various and contrary objective conceptions. This is peculiar to God, who understands not by help of external or concreated species, as Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures do; but by the intention of his own infinite Essence, which is most singularly one, and by one intellect <hi>à parte Dei,</hi> God un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstands all things at once, who is the wise and mighty Creator of our souls, and is both within us and without us, and every where present, unto him therefore alone we are to make our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, and by so doing the holy Angels and Saints will love us in him, and what lyes in them procure our welfare, seeing every one that is good, doth love and desire to please him, who is the Supreme good.</p>
               <p>To this truth some of the Socinians have readily subscribed, and afforded us their suffrages, and do account their Brethren to be no better then Idolaters, because they, notwithstanding their Principle that Christ is but a Creature, yet do they acknowledg and prove that he is to be invocated. The reasons of these dissenting brethren, which are our reasons also, are these.</p>
               <p>First, They are true Idolaters which do serve and call on them, which are not the true God. This Proposition is proved, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.8.</p>
               <p>But in the opinion of the Socinians, Christ is not the true God.</p>
               <p>Therefore, They by doing service to him are Idolaters.</p>
               <p>Secondly, They that call on their fellow servants and adore their brethren with Religious worship, they are reproved by the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Angel, <hi>Apoc.</hi> 19. But Christ if he be a pure man, is our fellow ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and our brother.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He that calls on a Creature is blasphemous to God. <hi>Deuter.</hi> 4.6.10, 17. <hi>Matth.</hi> 4. But Christ is a Creature, say the Socinians.</p>
               <pb n="454" facs="tcp:118911:254"/>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> the Prophet speaking in the name of God, pronounceth him cursed that trusts in man, as they do which reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously invocate his person,</p>
               <p n="5">5. Lastly, Religious Invocation is Gods glory, which he will give to no other, <hi>Isaiah</hi> 42. and therefore not to Christ, if he be not God.</p>
               <p>These Arguments are alledged out of <hi>Franciscus Davidis Bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> and <hi>Christianus Franku,</hi> by Learned <hi>Hoornbeck, Apparatu. pag.</hi> 33. And <hi>Legate,</hi> obstinate <hi>Legate,</hi> burned in <hi>Smithfield An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no Domini,</hi> 1611. professed to King <hi>James,</hi> That he for seven years prayed not to Jesus, though formerly in his ignorance he had invocated his Name.

               <p>But the other Socinians do account these men for denying the lawfulnesse of prayers to Christ, to be impious, and do renounce their Brother-hood, and do not esteem them to be Christians, <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin. in.

And the truth is thus confirmed; for our Saviour, the Husband of his Church (being exempted from possibility of offending his Father) requires his Beloved (and therefore it is lawful) and calls upon her to pray unto him, and he delightfully hears her prayers, which are as sweet melody to his ears, <hi>Let me hear thy voice, for it is sweet,</hi> Cant. 2.14 And his faithful servants in their due acknowledgment of his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Greatnesse, and in obedience to him their great Lord, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him with their homage of prayers to his Divine Majesty: and father <hi>Jacob wrastled with Jehovah, he wept and made supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions unto him, and would not let him go till he had blessed him.</hi> Christ said not to him by way of reproof, as he did to his wife <hi>Rachel,</hi> with indignation, <hi>Am I God, to blesse thee with children?</hi> Gen. 30.1. Or as the King of <hi>Israel</hi> spoke of the Letters of the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Am I God, to kill and make alive, and to heal a Leper?</hi> Or as the Angel admonished <hi>John</hi>

                  </gap>, <hi>See thou worship not me:</hi> but he accepted of his prayers. And when the enraged enemies of Saint <hi>Stephen,</hi> (who had this high honour, to be the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Martyr) were unmercifully stoning him, <hi>He kneeled downe and said, Lord Jesus receive my spirit,</hi> Acts 7.59. This was so common a practice amongst Christians, that the Disciples were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed by this Character, to be <hi>such as called on the name of Christ, Acts</hi> 9.14. And this was famously known to the enemies of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:118911:254"/>which were amazed at this wonderful Conversion of <hi>Saul,</hi> because not long before he was bloudily bent to <hi>destroy them which called on the Name of Jesus,</hi> ver 21. and the same blessed Apostle writes, <hi>That the Saints in every place called on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ,</hi> 1 Corinth. 1.2. These two are <hi>Synonymaes</hi> of equal la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, to be a Saint, and to call on Christ, and this latter is an explication of the former. And to conclude, Saint <hi>John</hi> (with all that out of their ardent affection desire more fully to enjoy him whom their souls do love) prayeth fervently, <hi>Come Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, come quickly,</hi> Revel. 22.20.</p>
               <p>Hence I argue against the Socinians:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That Person which knowes the hearts of all men, and hears the Prayers of all the men in the world, at all times and in all places, is the true God, because a Creature, (as Christ must be if he be not the Creator) is limited both in Essence, in Vertue, and in operation, nor is it possible for him to hear at once all prayers in all places, and at all times, that is not of infinite perfection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Jesus Christ knowes the hearts of all men, and hears their prayers, as is proved; else were it in vain to pray to him:</hi> Ergo, <hi>He is God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3 Its an honour peculiar to God to be the Object of Religious trust and confidence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He that is the Object of Religious Trust and Confidence, is God:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But Jesus Christ is the Object of Religious Trust and Confidence:</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>The Major is thus proved; Because it is reasonable and expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, that the Person on whose word we do depend for all the good things of this life, and the life to come, be</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>Eternal.</hi> On this account Princes are not to be confided in, for they must dye, and then they fail those that hope in them: but God is one and the same for ever.</p>
               <p n="2">2 That it be such an eternal Cause, on which all others do depend: for why should we rely on that person which is under the power of another, and may be overpowered by a Superior?</p>

It is not only the King
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:118911:255"/>of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that is a staffe of reed, but all creatures are like the flouds of <hi>Job, Job</hi> 6.15, 16, 17. which will then deceive us, when we have the greatest need of them; yea, and a curse is denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the Prophet <hi>Jeremy, chap.</hi> 17. against those which trust in man, and which do rely on the arm of <hi>flesh.</hi> How should any Creatures be firm props to lean on, when all of them from the lowest to the highest do depend on God for their being, their preservation and their operations? God set up the world as a fair and goodly Clock (as Mr. <hi>Culverwel</hi> a young man of rare abilites, saith) to strike in time, and to move in an orderly manner, not by its own weights, but by fresh influences from himself, by that inward and intimate spring of immediate concourse that should supply it in a most uniform &amp; proportionable manner (<hi>Ch.</hi> 2.) <hi>viz</hi> light of nature Its true, that Israelites are said, not only to believe the Lord, but his servant <hi>Moses, Exod.</hi> 14 31. that is, they believed Gods Word spoken to them by <hi>Moses.</hi> They believed not on the Messenger of God, but on the message which he brought; to believe on the means is to go a whoring after strange Gods: and as it is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a bad sight to be terminated by the Aire, which is <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium videndi,</hi> so is it of a bad hope to rest on the meanes of grace.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Minor</hi> is proved, <hi>That Jesus Christ is the Object of our faith,</hi> and it is a great sin, for which the world shall be condemned, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they believed not on him.</hi> John 16.9. Again, <hi>Whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him shall have everlasting life,</hi> Joh. 3.16. But most convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly, <hi>John</hi> 14.1. Our Saviour Christ invites his Disciples and all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers in a way of absolute adherence to depend upon him, as they do upon God the Father, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled, ye believe in God, believe also in me.</hi> The strength of this Argument is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>He that is God is to be believed on: But I am God;</hi> therefore, <hi>I am to be believed on.</hi> And if ye ought to believe in me, and are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded so to do, you ought not to be troubled with worldly cares or fears. Now this being a commandment without all limitation or exception, proves that the Disciples were to depend upon Christ after the same manner that they are to rely on God the Father, and consequently doth evince, that he is true God, and not a divine man. Nor is it credible, that he in the same sentence being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God, would not have set a mark of difference betwixt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in God the Father, and believing in him, if he had not been
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:118911:255"/>true God. It is true, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.31. <hi>The people believed the Lord, and his servant Moses;</hi> that is, they believed Gods Word made known to them by his servant <hi>Moses:</hi> but would God endure it, or would any divine man, as <hi>Moses,</hi> speak in this manner, <hi>Believe in God, believe in me also?</hi> Prophets and Apostles were sent by God to be believed. but not to be believed on, that is Gods pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar right. And would not any man judge it arrogancy to hear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thus speak? <hi>Believe in me.</hi> And would it not be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to give divine honour to that Creature, and make it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual with God? The Son and the Father are then to be looked on by the eye of faith as that one Supreme Object of their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To sweare is a part of Religious service, when performed in Judgement, Truth, and Righteousness, which analogically is ascri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to Christ himself. I reason thus:</p>
               <p>That Person which is the object of a Religious Oath is God, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Thou shalt swear by his Name,</hi> who is a most infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Witnesse, Judg and Avenger of all perjured persons, and such as take his Name either rashly or falsely. It is true; that in Oaths by Creatures, the Lord is indirectly called in as a witnesse, and such Oathes redounds to God, as, <hi>He that sweareth by the Temple, sweareth by him that dwelleth in the Temple; and he that sweareth by heaven, sweareth by Gods Throne, and by him that sits on it,</hi> Matth. 23.21, 22. yet doth it not follow, that Christ approveth such Oaths, because they are not agreeable to the Word of God and do exalt the Creature above its state and condition into Gods Throne; and do ascribe Omniscience and Omnipotency to them.</p>
               <p>But Christ is the Object of a Religious Oath; and because he hath no greater to swear by, he swears by himself, <hi>Isai.</hi> 45. <hi>I have sworn by my self, every knee shall bow to me;</hi> here Christ swears by himself, and the words immediately before, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. <hi>I am God, and besides me there is none other,</hi>

We must bow the knee to the Lord, and be judged by Christ; for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Socinian Doctrine the consequence is good which
<pb n="458" facs="tcp:118911:256"/>is taken from the Worship of Christ to the Worship of God; but from the Worship of God to the Worship of Christ. the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence is rejected, for God may be worshipped when Christ is not worshipped, but the honour done to Christ redounds to God. So they.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Lastly, to name no more, Divine service is an honor solely due to God, both in the Old Testament, <hi>Deuter.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Thou shalt serve him.</hi> And in the New no lesse then in the Old; for Christ repeating that Law, <hi>Deuter</hi> 6. of serving God, a duty of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours founded on the Divine Nature, as most worthy to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, addes the exclusive Particle, which is not in the Hebrew, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. <hi>It is written, the Lord thy God thou shalt [only] serve.</hi> Inward and outward service, which is absolute, illimited and univerfal, is to be performed only to God.</p>
               <p>This honour is due to Christ: and as he is the great Lord, he is thus to be served; all people, Nations, and Languages are bound to serve him, and not the meaner sort only, but the greatest Kings, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.14. <hi>Psal.</hi> 2.10, 11, 12. And this was fortold, <hi>Psal.</hi> 72.11. <hi>All Kings shall fall down before him, all Nations shall serve him;</hi> And those enemies which will not have Christ to raign over them, as a King over loyal and obedient subjects, they (as his enemies) shall be slain before him, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.27. <hi>But if any man will serve me</hi> (saith our Saviour) <hi>he shall be where I am, and my Father will honour him,</hi> John 12.29. And not only men, but the holy Angels are bound to serve him, <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.6. Thus much of this fifth Argument.</p>

               <p n="1">1. The first Work of Christ, is the first Creation. I argue thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Maker of Heaven and Earth, and all things in them, is the God of Israel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jesus Christ is the Maker of Heaven and Earth:</hi> Ergo.</p>
               <p>The Major is proved by Scripture and by Reason. The Reason is, Because Creation is a work of Omnipotency, making the first matter out of the barren womb of nothing, not as the matter of the Creatures, but as the term from whence they came, and all the Creatures, which were made of it (for Accidents are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Created, but concreated) by no lesse infinite Power then the first masse or lump it self without form was made. If <hi>Adam</hi> in his first estate, or if the holy Angels of God had been created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the first matter, and if that first matter when once it was made, had been brought by the Almighty power of God to them (as the Creatures were to <hi>Adam</hi> to give th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m names, <hi>Genes.</hi> 2.19.) it had not been possible for them, I will not only say, to have made the other Creatures, but so much as to have devised the form and Workmanship, which now they do with delight see and wonder at in the meanest Creatures. It must then alwayes be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that <hi>Moses</hi> in the very beginning of that divine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture layes down this as a main foundation of Religion, <hi>Genes.</hi> 1.1. <hi>In the beginning God created heaven and earth:</hi> And this is a glory to be Creatour, which belongs to none but to God himself: for, <hi>I am the first and the last</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>surely my hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens,</hi> Isai. 48.12. And that the Israelites might not forget this, the Lord, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.11. in the fourth Commandment, spake in the hearing of all Israel, <hi>In six dayes the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are in them:</hi> as by those things which are in the earth, men by an excellencie are to be understood; so by all things in heaven Angels are to be understood, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, there was no Creature did exist before the six dayes, but all of them were made in the compasse of that time. And the Lord doth arm the Jewes which were to be carried into captivity against all Idolatry, with this spiritual sword, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 10.11. <hi>They are no Gods which have not made Heaven and earth.</hi> So also, he who hath made the Earth with his Power, and establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the World by his Wisdom, and stretched out the Heavens by
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:118911:257"/>his Discretion, is the true God, <hi>ver.</hi> 12. Who can then doubt, but that he who made heaven and earth is the Almighty? And if we can find any one to have made all these things, we may know him thereby to be the true God; for God cannot possible make a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing Omnipotent, and able to create something of nothing; for though he be Omnipotent, yet is it a contradiction to say, there can be two Omnipotents, the one uncreated, the other created; and all one as to say, there are two Gods, a made and an unmade God.</p>
               <p>Now Christ is the Maker of Heaven and Earth, and all things in heaven and earth: whatsoever had any beginning of their Being (as all things in the world except God himself) had that beginning and being of theirs by the Word or Son of God; <hi>John</hi> 1.3. <hi>All things were made by him,</hi> and if any thing can be more full to take away all exception, <hi>there was nothing that was not made by him; he made the world,</hi> ver. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. There is nothing so glorious in heaven above, nothing so mean on earth below; nothing so hidden in the depths of the sea or bowels of the earth (saith <hi>Chrysostom, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil.</hi> 66. <hi>ad popul. Antioch.</hi>) but had their substances, qualities and operations from our Saviour Christ. Nor can this be meant of the new Creation, which is, without all necessity, to leave the literal sense, and to flye to a Metaphor: by this Interpretation, the allusion to the History of the Creation, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.1. is lost, and the Analogy betwixt the Type and thing represented by it, is not observed, if in the first Creation God made all things without the Word, but nothing without the Word in the new. But that you may be assured the words are not meant of the new Creation, it is said of the world that was made by him, that <hi>he was in the world, and the world knew him not.</hi> Surely the renewed world, the new Creatures knew him, and therefore it cannot be meant of them. And to say, if they were not reformed, it was no fault of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and therefore he may be said to make the world, because what in him lay he reformed it. If this should have been the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelists meaning, he might have said, the world was made by <hi>John the Baptist,</hi> and by the holy Apostles, for they laboured what was in them to draw them to repentance and bring them to Christ. But what Christian ears would endure such a saying. <hi>John the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist</hi> and the holy Apostles made the world? And upon the same account it might be said, that the most impious livers and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:118911:257"/>Idolaters were reformed by Christ; and that <hi>Moses</hi> brought the Israelites which perished in the wildernesse, into the Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and that a Physician hath healed his Patient which grows weaker daily, and dies of his Disease; for none of these were wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to do what was in their power for the good of their charge: nay it may be said, that a vanquished Army which fought valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, conquered their enemies, yet every one knowes that such man<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner of speeches are both false and unusual in the world. To say no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, that many were reformed in the old Testament, and yet this reformed world could not, in the opinion of the Adversaries, be made by Christ, for that which was not, could not work at all.</p>
               <p>I will add but one place more, <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.16. <hi>All things were made by Christ, things visible, and</hi> (such as are not expressy mentioned by <hi>Moses</hi> in the Creation) <hi>things invisible, all things in earth and in heaven, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities or Powers, &amp;c.</hi> to shew, that nothing at all is excepted; the Apostle addes, <hi>All things were created by him,</hi> as the efficient cause of them, and for him as the end. The Apostle makes mention of these Angels however di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished, and proves thereby that <hi>Christ is the first born of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Creature,</hi> ver. 15. that is, he is before the Creature in time, in dignity and authority; and shewes that Christ doth infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel the most excellent Creatures of all, even the holy Angels and the highest of them all; much lesse can any inferiour Creature be compared with him, for Christ is the Creator of them, and they are but Effects. There is as much difference betwixt them and Christ, as there is betwixt the Cause and the Effect, the Creator, and the Creature. If Saint <hi>Paul</hi> had meant the new Creation, why used he not such words as might expresse his meaning? And how can that be extended to all things mentioned by <hi>Paul,</hi> when many of them are not capable of the new Creation? Such are all sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and unreasonable things in earth and in heaven; nor is the new Creation agreable to the state of the holy Angels; for refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation alwayes presupposeth a deformation. The holy Creatures were never old Creatures, <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.i.</hi> defiled with sin, therefore they cannot be made new Creatures. To say, as Adversaries, they were made by him; that is, they had him a new Lord, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had not over them, is to use the word in such a sense as the Scriptures never use it, and otherwise to expound <hi>Making</hi>
                  <pb n="462" facs="tcp:118911:258"/>when referred to men, and when to Angels; and by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position, so often as there was a new King in <hi>Israel,</hi> we might say, That all things that were in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> were made by this new King, which is absurd, nor will a wise man ever speak in that manner. If any Angels then were made by Christ in the Socinians sense of the new Creation, they must be Divels; and such stomacks have they, that they can concoct this, that the divels are made new Creatures and reformed by Christ; <hi>.i.</hi> they are subject to Christ, and their power is weakned by him. But is Christs rule over them as rebellious enemies, is his frustrating their wicked designes a creating of them? By this reason we might say, the divels were made by the Disciples, for by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Christ they were made subject to them, and cast out of the possessed by them. This of the first Effect.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>He that is the Preserver of all things is God:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Christ is the Preserver of all things:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>He is God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Major is thus illustrated, Preservation is a work equivalent to Creation; and it is a continuation of those Creatures which Gods hands have made. All that is in the world hath been created by him, and so are all things preserved, upheld and continued by him; they had been a <hi>non entity,</hi> nothing, but for him; and such is their imperfection and dependency on the first cause, that they would fall back to nothing without him, as those Religious Levites, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.5. do acknowledge; <hi>Of him, and to him, and by him are all things,</hi> Rom. 11.36. All things are of him as the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of them; all things are for him, as the utmost final Cause for which they were created; and all things are by him as the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving cause of them all. Creation and Preservation are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly two acts, but one Action, yet with this difference; in regard of the first instant, it is called Creation, in regard of the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the same influx begun, which addes nothing to Creation, it is called Conservation: As for example, The Sun enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the Aire by beames, and without any new act of the Suns to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten, the light of the aire, by the continuation of the same rayes, is preserved. So that Conservation is a continued Creation. Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion builds the house, but Conservation holds it up and repaires it. A house might as well stand without a foundation, and the work of Art without the <hi>substratum</hi> of natural Creatures, as any
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:118911:258"/>thing of it self can stand without God. What can a Mason do without stones? or a Carpenter without wood? just nothing: no more can natural things subsist without God, who is <hi>Natura Naturans,</hi> as the Schoolmen speak. Hence is it that the annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or reducing a Creature to nothing, is but a suspension of Gods concourse from that Creature. See <hi>Rada part</hi> 2. <hi>page</hi> 57. All the Reformed Churches, yea, and the Papistical also do agree in this Tenet with one consent, albeit there is a difference touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the actions of the Creatures, whether Gods concourse be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and undivided from the Creatures, which is denyed by <hi>Durandus, Lodovicus à Dola,</hi> and others; which say, that they being preserved, can act by the general composure of their natures, which is as improbable, as that an Instrument of Musick set in tune can make any Musick, and sound forth in a sweet and harmonious manner the praises of God, without the finger of a skilful Musi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian. Yet all do well agree, that God doth immediately by his concurse or <hi>influxus conservationis</hi> uphold all Creatures; and not only the meaner sorts of them, but the heavens themselves, our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal souls, and the Angelical spirits.</p>
               <p>Conservation is the work of our Lord Christ, he upholds all things by the word of his power, by his powerful command, his holy will and pleasure, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 1.3. So long as Creatures remain in their being, so long it is the will and pleasure of Christ to work that they should continue. And not a few things only, but all things are upheld by him, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. In the former verse it is said, that <hi>by him were made the worlds;</hi> not the world to come, for that is not called simply <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, but with an addition, the world to come, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 6.5. and <hi>cap.</hi> 2.5. Nor doth the Apostle speak in the time to come, <hi>He will make;</hi> or present, <hi>he doth make;</hi> but of a thing already done, <hi>He hath made the world.</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 10. The old Creation is directly proved to be by Christ. Hence I argue,
<q>
                     <l>
                        <hi>That world which was created by Christ, is upheld by Christ:</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>The old world and natural Creatures were made by Christ:</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>Ergo, <hi>The world is upheld by Christ.</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>A parallel Text of Scripture to confirm this truth, is <hi>Colos.</hi> 1.17. <hi>All things; viz.</hi> all Angels and things on earth which were crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Christ, <hi>ver.</hi> 15, 16. do subsist in Christ. The generallity is expressed, <hi>All things;</hi> all things without exception, not only
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:118911:259"/>the kinds of things are contained in their-being, but all the Indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals in every kind do subsist in him, together with the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the essential qualities of all the Creatures. This is also confirmed by the immediate voice of Christ himself. <hi>My Father doth work hitherto, and I do work, viz.</hi> hitherto, <hi>John</hi> 5.17. In the first six dayes he created all things, and then he rested touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Creation of new kinds of Creature; yet doth the Father and the Son of God still work to preserve the world by his power, to govern it by his Counsel and Wisdom, and to cherish it by his goodnesse. Whatsoever things the Father doth, the Son doth the very self-same things likewise, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Thirdly, Infallible knowledg and prediction of future Events, which are meerly contingent, and which in nature have no reason at all of their futurition, is an Argument of the Deity. These have <hi>fundamentum cognoscibilitatis,</hi> as <hi>Suarez. Opusal. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de scientia media, cap.</hi> 2. saith, that is truth which is the foundation of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg. Whatsoever can be known is infallibly known by God, but not infallibly known by any created being, no not the future acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of natural things, as of the motion of the Sun, and burning of combustible things cast into the fire; because all future things, both in regard of their being and actions depend on Gods con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. For instance, A Water-Milne, be it never so well fitted to grind, yet without a fresh supplie of streams to turn about the Wheels, and of blasts of wind to wheel about the sails of the Wind-milne, moves not at all. Now God is a free Agent, and can suspend his concourse at his pleasure, he can alter and over power the second cause; and therefore no man can certainly say, no not the holy Angels themselves, whether combustible bodies shall be burnt in the flames, for we see that three men cast into the fiery Oven perished not, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3. nor had their bodies or garments sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with the heat thereof; and the Sun hath both stood still in <hi>Joshuahs</hi> dayes, yea, gone back in the reign of <hi>Hezekiah.</hi> But the Angels have neither light enough of their own to manifest a future object, nor eyes strong enough to pierce into it. But God knows his owne determinate will and purpose concerning all things, and he exactly knowes the created principles of all mens actions, and what they would do by Gods assistance when such and such objects,
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:118911:259"/>are presented to them, when they are most dubious, hovering be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>esse &amp; non esse;</hi> he plainly perceives which way they will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, when man only sees an equipoise and neutrality; he alwayes sees a contingency, <hi>in termino, in eventu, in pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riodo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is more contingent then the future mutable thoughts of man? yet he doth infallibly know our thoughts long before they were conceived by us, <hi>Psal.</hi> 139. even from eternity, as <hi>S James</hi> teacheth us, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.18. <hi>Known unto God are all his works from the beginning of the world:</hi> otherwise he should begin to know them when they begin to subsist, and his knowledg by new emergent cogitation would be encreased, which argues imperfection. And this is incompatible to the All-seeing eye, to which all things are naked and open; and this absurdity would also follow, that God should not be alwayes <hi>Actuatissimus, Scientissimus,</hi> as profound <hi>Bradwardine</hi> argueth, <hi>De Causa Dei, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1. And God should have a desire to know them, as every rational creature doth natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality to know things which are unknowne. I will not enter into a Dispute in this place, how God knowes future contingencies; this I have endeavoured to open at large, <hi>lib</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 351. <hi>Tertullian</hi> saith elegantly, <hi>Prophetical predictions, are infallible demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Deity, Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>contra Marcion. cap.</hi> 5. Yea, and our Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niscient God challengeth other Gods to bring forth their reasons to prove their Divine Nature; and it is this under our hand, <hi>Let them shew us what things are to come</hi> (infallibly and at all times) <hi>that we may know that ye are Gods,</hi> Isai. 41.23. Hence is he called, <hi>a God of knowledg,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.3. <hi>And a God infinite in understanding, Psal.</hi> 147.5. By the same way and meanes God knowes something he knowes all. Nor doth God only know future things, which the Divine Essence as willing them represents to his infinite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, but also he knowes future conditional things, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall have a being; he knowes them as a potent cause to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them, though not as a working Cause to effect them, <hi>Halens. de Trinitat. quaest.</hi> 23. <hi>art. membro.</hi> 3. <hi>artic.</hi> 1. See Scriptures and many reasons to prove this, <hi>page</hi> 360. The denyal of Gods knowledg of future things, is to put away one of the strongest and convincing proofes that we have, that the holy Scriptures are the Word of God. See 1. <hi>Book pag.</hi> 145. It is a great dishonour to God to deny, as the Socinians do, the Election and Reprobation
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:118911:260"/>of singular persons to be from eternity, because, as they dream, he doth not infallibly know the future contingent actions, which are the issues of free will.</p>
               <p>Our blessed Saviour foreknew and foretold things to come; not to insist on the Predictions to <hi>Abraham</hi> and others in the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, he visibly sometimes appearing, but the Father never, as is conceived. <hi>Peter</hi> acknowledged this truth; Christ asked him, <hi>Peter, lovest thou me?</hi> He said, <hi>Lord, thou knowest all things.</hi> And, as he was God, exactly knew whatever in time to come should be in the world; for there can be no reason given why he should foreknow some contingencies, and not all. But he did foretell that <hi>Judas</hi> should betray him; he sent <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> to prepare the Passeover, and tells them, when they are entered into <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, there shall a man meet you bearing a Pitcher of water, follow him into the house where he entreth in, and say to the Master of the house, The Master saith, Where is the Guest-Chamber? and he will shew you a large upper room furnished. And they went and found as he had said,</hi> Luke 22.8. He did also foresee and foretel that <hi>Peter,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his confidence to adhere to him, would deny him thrice, and it fell out accordingly. There is not the least footstep, that these (in time) were revealed to his person; but that as he by his Spirit, by his divine Spirit knew the secrets of mens hearts, <hi>Mark</hi> 2.8. and dived into the inside of a man, into his very thoughts, <hi>John</hi> 24.25. so by the same spirit could foretel infallibly future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingencies. <hi>The truth of Divination is an evident proof of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> saith <hi>Tertullian Apologet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A fourth work to prove the Deity of Christ, is taken from his Miracles. And I argue thus:</p>
               <q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>He that works Miracles by his own power, is God:</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Christ wrought Miracles by his own power:</hi> Ergo.</l>
               </q>
               <p>For the opening and proving of the Major, observe, that a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, to speak properly, is an outward sensible work, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.8. and 11.3, 4. which doth exceed the utmost ability of any created be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Many things (I grant) are marvellous and wonderful to us, which are not Miracles, albeit they are produced above nature ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily, as the Creation of the world, where divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence settled the course of Nature; and every dayes creation of immortal souls, and the comfortable infusion of sanctifying gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are not properly Miracles, <hi>August. de Trin. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 6.</p>
               <pb n="467" facs="tcp:118911:260"/>
               <p>And it is further required, that a Miracle be done perfectly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defect, and presently without delay. I do not mean simply, for then those Instances, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.33. and <hi>Mark</hi> 8.24. would confute me; but they are done without delay, because they are effected in the same moment that the Lord would have them done.</p>
               <p>Now that Miracles are Gods royal Prerogative, and his peculiar works, the Psalmist avoucheth. <hi>The Lord above doth wondrous works,</hi> Psal. 78.18. What can be more plainly or more fully spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? No holy man on earth, no Angel in heaven, no not the humane Nature of our Saviour dignified above all Created excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, could originally from it self produce a Miracle. <hi>Jehoram</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi> shewed his just indignation against the Letters of the King of <hi>Syria,</hi> 2 <hi>King.</hi> 5.7. saying, <hi>Recover my servant of his Leprosie, Am I</hi> (saith he religiously) <hi>a God, to kill and make alive?</hi> This then is a glory peculiar to the Lord God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Our Saviour wrought Miracles when and where he would, as none else ever could do; <hi>My Father quickneth whom he will;</hi> there it will follow, that the Son working Miracles, is proved thereby to be God: But the holy Apostles which were happy In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments to raise some from death to life, could not alwayes raise their own beloved friends from their beds of sicknesse, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.8. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.20. In the prevailing famine in King <hi>Ahabs</hi> Raigne, there were many (poor and) widowes in <hi>Israel,</hi> but unto none of them all was the Prophet sent, but to the relief of a poor widow in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repthah.</hi> And there were many Lepers in <hi>Israel</hi> in the dayes of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisha</hi> the Prophet, yet none of them all were miraculously cured by him, but only a stranger, <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.25. But now when it is said, as the Father, so the Son raiseth whomsoever he pleaseth, this proves that he is the principal efficient, and not the Instrument of working Miracles: Is the work done ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of the Instrument, or of the principal cause? <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.21. It is Gods property alone to do whatsoever pleaseth him. <hi>Psal.</hi> 115.3.</p>
               <p>Secondly, I add, That Christ wrought such Miracles as no man ever wrought, and that by his owne power, as to cure a man and give him sight, who was born blind, <hi>John</hi> 9.32. and which is more wonderful, to raise up his own dead body. I may truly say, since
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:118911:261"/>the world begun, this was never yet, nor shall ever be done. And as himself saith, <hi>If I do not the works which no man ever did, they had not sinned,</hi> John 15.24. But now they have seen, and their malicious opposing them doth evidence that they do not only hate me, but my Father also. Doth not this prove that he wrought Miracles in a far more excellent way and manner of working, then could be found amongst men? So that his Miracles were very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, yet not alway prevalent; for there were many Spectators of them which were hardned by them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Christ did the same works which his Father did, and after the same manner, <hi>John</hi> 5.17. whereby he is fully distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from all others, which were instruments under God; for which of them all either can or dare say, that he worketh after the same manner that God doth work.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Christ works his Miracles by his own power and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, for he commands both the tempestuous winds and the raging sea, and they do obey him, and there is a great calme, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.39. As God commanded light to shine out of darkness, so did our blessed Saviour exercise his Authority and Soveraignity in his commands to the Creatures, and well might they say one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him?</hi> But men do not, nor can thus work as Christ wrought his Miracles. It is true. That Christ (as himself confesseth) can do nothing of himself, <hi>John</hi> 5.19. And whatsoever Christ hath, he hath it from the Father by communicating it to him. Yet is it also true, that he hath this Almighty power in himself, and works all by himselfe; nor do those words import any impotency in Christ without his Father; but they shew his most absolute and perfect equality with God the Father, as the next words do evince.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, He did not only Miracles himself, but he gave power to work them in his name. They should cast out Divels, they should speak strange Languages (without any study) they should not be hurt by Serpents nor by drinking poison, and they should by laying on their hands recover the sick, <hi>Mark</hi> 16, 17, 18. which promise began to be fulfilled <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and 3.12. Christ gave them such an admirable gift, that upon the using of his Name, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned and other such wonderful effects should follow, that could not be done by the sons of men.</p>
               <pb n="469" facs="tcp:118911:261"/>
               <p>It is true, that Christ Jesus himself wrought Miracles in the name of his Father, <hi>John</hi> 10.25. for we do confesse that our Saviour, as he was man, derived his Power and Authority to work them from God, and was in this consideration his Instrument; yet even then neither whole Christ, nor the whole of Christ was Gods Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in such miraculous works; nor is inferiority necessarily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed by him, who saith he doth a thing in the Name of another, as appears <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. <hi>Baptize in the Name</hi> (not in the names) <hi>of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost:</hi> here is implyed a co-equality or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power in God the Father, God the Son, and God the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost: And if such a collection should be sound, Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self will have Authority over his Father, for he sends his Spirit in the Name of Christ, <hi>John</hi> 14.26. If we shall by name understand Power and Authority, then did Christ work Miracles by his owne Authority, as he did in truth, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.16. <hi>Peter</hi> saith, <hi>Christs name hath made this Cripple strong and sound.</hi> Now when it is said our Lord wrought Miracles in his Fathers name, the meaning is, he wrought them to glorifie his Father, and then it is no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to say, they were done by his own Authority, to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers honour.</p>
               <p>Christ then (to returne to my Argument) gave power to his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles and others to work Miracles, but these could not give it to any others, albeit some by the imposition of the hands of two A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> had extraordinary external gifts, as of heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diseases, and Prophesie conferred on them, and the Apostles sharply rebukes <hi>Simon Magus</hi> because he profanely thought that gift might be bought with money, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.20.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and lastly, This is strongly proved from this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Christ was by his working of Miracles demonstrated to be the Son of God, the only begotten Son of God, and equal with his Father, <hi>John</hi> 5.18, 19. And again saith Christ, <hi>Whether is it easier to say, Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say, Take up thy bed and walk?</hi> Matth. 9 5. These are impossible for men, both of them do belong to God.</p>
               <p>To conclude this Argument, that I might prevent mistakes, it must be remembred, that I do not argue from the working of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles simply in themselves considered, That Christ because he wrought them was the most High God. For it is apparant that many Disciples, especially in the first plantation of Christian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
<pb n="482" facs="tcp:118911:262"/>had this gift of working Miracles. But here lies the strength of my Argument, That the Miracles of our Saviour were wrought by his own power, in his own name, to his own glory, and that as he was Lord of his Creatures, which obedientially served him, and were wrought on by his commanding way, when ever he would himself use this power; and in that he gave power to others to work Miracles, which Saint <hi>Peter</hi> would have all the people of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi> to take notice of, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.10. And this was also his gift, (which is a remarkable circumstance) after his ignominious death. It is no great wonder, that a great and potent Monarch having store of Moneyes, which are the sinewes of War, and a numerous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of valiant Souldiers, should atchieve notable and famous Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctories; but that our blessed Saviour after he was truly dead and buried, should give power to others to work wonders on the Land and in the Sea, which neither man nor Angel can imitate, as Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith truly, is a strong Argument of his Deity, <hi>Homil.</hi> 66. <hi>ad p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>These recited Works are wrought by Christ, and appertained to him as a powerful Creator; and like to these are those works which do belong to him as a merciful Redeemer; yet for the clearer evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hereof I will alledge them as a distinct Argument.</p>

               <p>Seventhly and lastly, It was requisite that Christ should not only be a true man, but very God also, for the accomplishment of Gods glorious designe and gracious purpose in mans Redemption. It is true, Christ was Mediatour before his Incarnation; <hi>viz.</hi> by his Word and Spirit, and acting there in reference to the Nature which should in the fulnesse of time be assumed into his Person; but he was not so perfectly a Saviour as now he is. This second Person of the glorious Trinity is named <hi>Jesus,</hi> and he is so called from the end, which is most excellent, to save men from their sins and
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:118911:262"/>hell, and to confer righteousnesse and life on all Believers. And the name of Messias and Christ imports his Offices, which are the divinely instituted means to attain that end, that is, the salvation of mens souls: a meer Creature Priest, a meer Creature Prophet, and a meer Creature King, could not perform those several actions which were necessarily to be done by Christ, who was a Priest, a King, and a Prophet, all three happily meeting in him, and in him alone.</p>
               <p>Christ in regard of his Priestly Office (which was not after the order of <hi>Levi,</hi> but after the order of <hi>Melchisedech</hi>) offered up his body as a propitiatory Sacrifice by his eternal Spirit, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us to God the Father, to obtain remission of sins, spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual graces and life eternal by an All sufficient price laid down for us.</p>
               <p>It is true, That God is said to love the world, and out of his love to the world to give his <hi>Son to dye for the Elect,</hi> John 3.16. and <hi>freely to forgive all our sins.</hi> But this is not opposite to the merits and satisfaction of Christ, which belong to him as a Priest and Sacrifice; for we must consider a double reference of Gods love; the one is towards the Creature, the other is towards his Justice and hatred of sin. God would have his Son to satisfie them both with due recompence: he satisfied his love to the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creature, when he gave his Son to be our Mediator: he satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his love to justice and his hatred of sin, when he gave his S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n to dye for us, and by his blood to expiate our sins: he satisfied his love to the Creature, because out of love he forgives sins freely in regard of the Creature, though it was by laying the punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our sins on his dear Son to satisfie his Justice; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing his love to Justice and hatred of sin, he out of his love to the Elect forgives their sins, and gives unto them eternal life; in which respect it may be truly said, God satisfied himself, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peased himself in his Beloved Son. Now the blood of a meer man which was to dye, cannot give due satisfaction to Gods Justice for those grosse and innumerable evils which sinful man hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted against the most pure and infinite Majesty of God. If the Church be not redeemed by the blood of God, as for certain it is, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. then is the Church not redeemed at all; then is our faith, and our preaching, then are all our holy Duties in vain, and we are under the guilt and dominion of our sins; then hath not
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:118911:263"/>God received a satisfactory Ransom for our souls: but Christ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God manifested in the flesh, is able to bear Gods wrath to the uttermost, and not sink under the burthen of it; he is able to pay the utmost farthing of our debts, and purchase no lesse then a Kingdom of Heaven, and a Crown of glory for us.</p>
               <p>It is storied of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> that he should say, he would remove the world, in case there was a Center assigned to him out of it, to fix his Engine; this work in a spiritual sense was effected by the man Christ Jesus, and by such a manner as the other was contrived, by having the humanity as an Engine united to the Deity as the Basis thereof, wherby he removed the whole spiritual frame of the world, to cast out the Prince of darknesse, and to draw all things to himself, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.32.</p>
               <p>Besides, this is such a glorious way of mans Redemption, that the Truth of God, the Holinesse of God, and Gods hatred of sin do shine forth in their brightnesse to the eyes of every spiritual Beholder: when we shall consider, that God would not spare his only natural Son, being voluntarily interressed in our cause, but proceed in rigour of Justice against him as our Surety, as if he had been the greatest Malefactor in the world, to receive an infinite sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction from him; for albeit his Justice will not be corrupted, yet it will be satisfied; if the wrath of God be infinite against sins, yet may a Sacrifice of infinite worth appease it.</p>
               <p>Christ was a Saviour meritoriously by his bitter death and passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: his suffring was in his humane Nature, but the force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his bitter passion throughout all generations depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Deity, because the Person that suffered in his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was true God. And albeit nothing is actually infinite in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but God only in that he is God; neverthelesse as the sin of <hi>Adam</hi> was finite in regard of the act, but in efficacy is said to be infinite, because it subjected all the race of <hi>Adam</hi> to damnation, why may not much more the passion of Christ, finite in time, be infinite in value, being the passion of an infinite God? for as a number is said to be infinite by possibility of addition, and a line by possibility of extention, so are there no limits which can be set to the value of Christs sacrificed body, it hath no measured bounds of efficacy, but is infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensively in possibility of application, even to the Redemption of a thousand worlds, if there had been so many, and is more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailable
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:118911:263"/>to acquit us of all our debts, then if all the men in the world had been everlastingly damned; &amp; when all is suffered, a finite sum can never discharge an infinite debt: All the sufferings of this world, yea, and in hell it self, are not worthy the future glory, though one man should suffer them all, is a very great, yet a true amplification. <hi>Bern. Serm.</hi> 2. <hi>in Annun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was it sufficient that Christ should be a Saviour in regard of merit (for without some further actings of Christ we cannot be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) but he must be a Saviour also in regard of efficacy. It was not possible for Christ to be long detained under the dominion of death, nor for the Guard about his Sepulcher to hinder his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. Death (as <hi>Luther</hi> saith) is an Omnipotent Queen and Empresse of all mankind, destroying Kings, Princes and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally all the sons of <hi>Adam.</hi> This death did mightily encounter with Christ, who is life it self, and thinking to overthrow him ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly as all other men, did indeed kill his body, but because his life was immortal, when it was overcome, did at last overcome and get the victory; (in <hi>cap.</hi> 3. <hi>ad Galat. ver.</hi> 13.) and by catching at the Bait of his Humanity, was caught with the Hook of his Divinity, Christ (I say) is a Saviour in efficacy, working those heavenly graces in us, whereby we are meet to enjoy Heaven: And upon this account it is, that <hi>he is able to save us perfectly,</hi> Heb. 7.25. He efficaciously applies to us the benefits which by his death he merited for us. His death was as the Gold and Silver, which gave the value to the precious Coyne; but Christs Resurrection, his sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at his Fathers right hand in heaven, and his Intercession there for us, are like the stamp of the Supreme Magistrate, and his Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, which makes the Coyne to be currant and passable amongst men. So that Christ ceased not to be a Prophet, Priest and King, when he ceased to be a mortal man, and to live in this inferior world; but he executes his Offices most powerfully and gloriously, being exalted far above all Principalities and Powers, and there he is our Advocate, and such an Advocate, as can plead the worthiness of his Person, his perfect obedience and meritorious sufferings, and can do whatever it pleaseth him to promote our happinesse. I will instance in a few particulars.</p>
               <p>First, Conversion, Illumination, and all-saving Graces are the free-gift of Jesus Christ. This is frequently prayed for in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Apostolical Epistles. <hi>Grace and Peace from God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:118911:264"/>and from Jesus Christ. The dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God and live,</hi> not only they which are dead in their bodies, but in their sins, shall be raised (as it were) out of the grave of sin, and live, <hi>John</hi> 5 26. <hi>Grace and Truth from Jesus Christ.</hi> Hence is his Greatnesse manifested (as Saint <hi>Chrysostom</hi> speaks) that he planted Churches all the world over, without weapons and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out money, and that also by unlikely means, by twelve inconside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable poor men, not trained up in humane Learning, and bringing with them a strange Doctrine to their ears, to renounce their Idols and customary conversation, to put their confidence in crucified Christ, to deny themselves, and to renounce all their sinful Lusts, and resolve to lay down their lives, and to forsake all they had for Christ; And albeit their enemies were all the Divels in hell, and all dissolute and profane persons on earth, and so must needs be trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with a violent Antipathy against them; so that the task undertaken by the Apostles to convert the Idolatrous and profane world, was as likely to miscarry, as if they had been sent to tame the Wild Beasts of the Wildernesses; and surely, had not a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty power assisted his servants, Religion had been choaked (as it were) in the first uprising, and strangled (as it were) in the Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle or Infancy. As <hi>Aarons</hi> Rod among the Socerers, so did the Word of God bear down all oppositions, and moved their enemies to submit their necks to the yoak of the Gospel; and this argued a divine power that cast down the walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> by the blasts of such Rams-hornes.</p>
               <p>Secondly, As this Divine and Spiritual King finds no Subjects in the world, but such as he had dearly purchased by his bloud, and effectually called by his Word and Spirit, So when they are once under him, he governes them by his holy Lawes, which do strictly require a pious and a righteous life, and protects them by his grace and power, and doth singularly care for them, as for his precious Jewels, and tenderly is affected to them as the father to the child, and the Shepherd to his flock, carying the Lambs in his armes, and professeth to their great comfort, that they shall not perish, <hi>John</hi> 10.28. but he kept in safety till they be actually possessed of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal in heritance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The same holy Jesus, who was annointed and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Holy Ghost, as he was man, insomuch that he had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces bestowed on him without measure; yet considered in his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:118911:264"/>as he was the Son of God, he sends the Holy Ghost to his servants, who dwels in them as in his Temple, whose glorious stile it is to be the Comforter, which is a precious cordial to them in the saddest times; and this doth also prove, that Christ is the true God, in that he can send the Holy Ghost, who is also the everlasting God.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Our blessed Lord, as he quickned his own dead body efficiently by his eternal Spirit, so will he likewise raise all the dead at the last day: he hath so triumphantly shattered the mighty chains of the grave into so small pieces, that it cannot perpetually be shut against the meanest of his servants, which shall be mercifully raised by him to their salvation; as the wicked shall also be quickned by him as their severe Judge to damne them. Hence doth he call himselfe, <hi>The Resurrection and the Life,</hi> John 6, 40. and as by <hi>the first Adam came death,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.21, 22 so <hi>by Christ Jesus the second Adam shall come the Resurrection of the dead.</hi> And is not this a work of Omnipotency?</p>
               <p>Fifthly, The dead being raised by Christs Almighty power, he will send his Angels to gather them all together, and to present them, though to the great horror and amazement of Divels and wcked ones, and they shall be forced to <hi>bow the knee to him who is the Lord of Hosts,</hi> Isai. 45.23. <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.10, 11. And he shall passe sentence on all, which cannot be done (as I shewed before) but by his Omniscience. And who do we expect to be the Judge of the quick and dead? Not God the Father, but <hi>we look for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearing of the great God, our Saviour Jesus Christ,</hi> Tit. 2.13.</p>
               <p>Lastly, to name no more, Christ will give unto his sheep Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life, <hi>John</hi> 10 28. and he saith, <hi>Father, I will that they which thou hast given me, be where I am,</hi> John 17.24. He speaks with Authority, <hi>I will,</hi> and like a co-essential and co-e ual person to the Father, he carries them up with himself to heaven, where they shall be happy for ever. He gives up his Kingdome, the Elect, as he is Mediator, and their God will be all in all.</p>
               <p>The enemies which do deny the Deity of our Saviour, would rob us of the comfort of the full assurance of the invaluable merits of his passion, of the full satisfaction to the Divine Justice for our sins, and of the perfect redemption purchased for us by his blood, and of his graces wrought in us by his Kingly power, and
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:118911:265"/>of his intercession for us, all which do depend upon his Deity, and the excellency of his person being God.</p>
               <p>These Arguments are strong and convincing demonstrations, which the cunning Divels by their seducing Instruments, with all their struggling and Sophistical Evasions, can never elude, but they will be like the Sun in the Firmament, the Motto of which excellent Creature is this, <hi>Acrior emergit,</hi> which breaks out of the clouds of opposition more brightly and more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously.</p>
